The play begins with three pages disputing over the black cloak usually worn by the actor who delivers the prologue . They draw lots for the cloak , and one of the losers , Anaides , starts telling the audience what happens in the play to come ; the others try to suppress him , interrupting him and putting their hands over his mouth . Soon they are fighting over the cloak and criticizing the author and the spectators as well . In the play proper , the goddess Diana , also called Cynthia , has ordained a solemn revels in the valley of Gargaphie in Greece . The gods Cupid and Mercury appear , and they too start to argue . Mercury has awakened Echo , who weeps for Narcissus , and states that a drink from Narcissus s spring causes the drinkers to Grow dotingly enamored of themselves . The courtiers and ladies assembled for the Cynthia s revels all drink from the spring . Asotus , a foolish spendthrift who longs to become a courtier and a master of fashion and manners , also drinks from the spring ; emboldened by vanity and self-love , he challenges all comers to a competition of court compliment . The competition is held , in four phases , and the courtiers are beaten . Two symbolic masques are performed within the play for the assembled revelers . At their conclusion , Cynthia ( representing Queen Elizabeth ) has the dancers unmask and shows that vices have masqueraded as virtues . She sentences them to make reparation and to purify themselves by bathing in the spring at Mount Helicon . The figure of Actaeon in the play may represent Robert Devereux , 2nd Earl of Essex , while Cynthia s lady in waiting Arete may be Lucy , Countess of Bedford , one of Elizabeth s ladies in waiting as well as Jonson s patroness . The play is notably rich in music , as is typical for the theatre of the boys ' companies , which originated as church choirs .

On the night of an undercard fight in Atlantic City , Micky s scheduled opponent is ill , and a substitute is found who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky , a huge difference in professional boxing , constituting two or three weight classes . Despite Micky s reservations , his mother and brother agree so that they can all get the purse and Micky is defeated . Micky retreats from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming , a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender . After several weeks , Alice arranges another fight for Micky , concerned it will turn out the same . His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation . Micky mentions he received an offer to be paid to train in Las Vegas , but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family . Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then , once she picks up a client , impersonating a police officer to steal the client s money . This is foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them . Micky tries to stop the police from beating his brother and a police officer brutally breaks his hand before arresting him . At their arraignment , Micky is released , but Dicky is sent to jail . Micky washes his hands of Dicky . On the night of the HBO documentary s airing , Dicky s family , and Dicky himself in prison , are horrified to see it is called Crack in America how crack addiction ruined Dicky s career and life . Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison . Micky is lured back into boxing by his father , who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences . The other members of his training team and a new manager , Sal Lanano , persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved . They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence . He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer . During a prison visit , Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent , but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career . During the actual match , Micky is nearly overwhelmed , but then implements his brother s advice and triumphs ; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed . Upon his release from prison , Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train . Assuming things are as they were , Dicky prepares to spar with his brother , but Micky informs him that he s no longer allowed per Micky s agreement with his current team . In the ensuing argument , in which Micky chastises both factions of his family , Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust . Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down . Dicky storms off , presumably to get high again , and Alice chides Micky , only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky . Dicky returns to his crack house , where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlene s apartment . He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together . After bringing everyone back together , the group goes to London for the title fight . Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title . The film jumps a few years ahead , with Dicky crediting his brother as the creator of his own success .

In a Louisiana assisted-living home in 1999 , Paul Edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat . His companion Elaine becomes concerned and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of the events of 1935 , which took place when he was a prison officer , in charge of death row and the state s electric chair . In 1935 , Paul supervises fellow officers Brutus Brutal Howell , Dean Stanton , Harry Terwilliger and Percy Wetmore at Cold Mountain Penitentiary on what they refer to as the Green Mile , Death Row . Paul , suffering from a severe bladder infection , receives a physically imposing , but mentally challenged , black man , John Coffey , into his custody ; John had been convicted of raping and murdering two little white girls . One of the other inmates is a Native-American named Arlen Bitterbuck , who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed . Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic and bullying streak , but is beyond reproach ; he is the nephew of Louisiana s First Lady , but only Paul is bold enough to defy this . He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard Del Delacroix ; he breaks Del s fingers with his baton , steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles , which Del had adopted , repeatedly calls him by a gay slur , and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del s head ; Del s body explodes in flames and he dies screaming in pain . John begins to demonstrate supernatural powers ; he cures Paul s bladder infection , resurrects Mr. Jingles , and heals Melinda Moores , wife of the prison s chief warden , of a brain tumor . This last affliction he releases into Percy , who under its influence shoots another prisoner , mass murderer William Wharton , dead . Wharton had from the moment of his arrival been a troublemaker ; he attacked the guards as he was being escorted into the block , made mischief on two occasions later which caused Paul to order him restrained in the block s padded cell , groped Percy briefly , racially insulted John , and revealed psychically to John that he is in fact responsible for the crime for which John was unjustly condemned . John then reveals the story psychically to Paul , but in so doing releases his supernatural energy into Paul . Percy , meanwhile , is committed to the insane asylum which , ironically , Wharton had come from , and where he , Percy , was hopeful of getting a job . John tells Paul , distraught over the notion of executing an innocent man , that he does in fact wish to die , as he views the world as a cruel place . Mentioning that he had never before seen a movie , John watches Top Hat with the other guards as a last request . That night , John is executed , although he refuses the customary hood , as he is afraid of the dark . Paul concludes his story by telling Elaine that John s was the last execution that either he or Brutus supervised ; following Coffey s execution they both took jobs in the juvenile system . Elaine realizes that , since he had a grown son in 1935 , Paul must be much older than he looks . Paul reveals that he is , in fact , 108 years of age , and not only is he still alive , so is Mr. Jingles , Del s mouse . Paul then muses that if John s power could make a mouse live for as long as Mr. Jingles has , how much longer does he himself have left ?

Elaine realizes that , since he had a grown son in 1935 , Paul must be much older than he looks . Paul reveals that he is , in fact , 108 years of age , and not only is he still alive , so is Mr. Jingles , Del s mouse . Paul then muses that if John s power could make a mouse live for as long as Mr. Jingles has , how much longer does he himself have left ?


In a Louisiana assisted-living home in 1999 , Paul Edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat . His companion Elaine becomes concerned and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of the events of 1935 , which took place when he was a prison officer , in charge of death row and the state s electric chair . In 1935 , Paul supervises fellow officers Brutus Brutal Howell , Dean Stanton , Harry Terwilliger and Percy Wetmore at Cold Mountain Penitentiary on what they refer to as the Green Mile , Death Row . Paul , suffering from a severe bladder infection , receives a physically imposing , but mentally challenged , black man , John Coffey , into his custody ; John had been convicted of raping and murdering two little white girls . One of the other inmates is a Native-American named Arlen Bitterbuck , who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed . Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic and bullying streak , but is beyond reproach ; he is the nephew of Louisiana s First Lady , but only Paul is bold enough to defy this . He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard Del Delacroix ; he breaks Del s fingers with his baton , steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles , which Del had adopted , repeatedly calls him by a gay slur , and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del s head ; Del s body explodes in flames and he dies screaming in pain . John begins to demonstrate supernatural powers ; he cures Paul s bladder infection , resurrects Mr. Jingles , and heals Melinda Moores , wife of the prison s chief warden , of a brain tumor . This last affliction he releases into Percy , who under its influence shoots another prisoner , mass murderer William Wharton , dead . Wharton had from the moment of his arrival been a troublemaker ; he attacked the guards as he was being escorted into the block , made mischief on two occasions later which caused Paul to order him restrained in the block s padded cell , groped Percy briefly , racially insulted John , and revealed psychically to John that he is in fact responsible for the crime for which John was unjustly condemned . John then reveals the story psychically to Paul , but in so doing releases his supernatural energy into Paul . Percy , meanwhile , is committed to the insane asylum which , ironically , Wharton had come from , and where he , Percy , was hopeful of getting a job . John tells Paul , distraught over the notion of executing an innocent man , that he does in fact wish to die , as he views the world as a cruel place . Mentioning that he had never before seen a movie , John watches Top Hat with the other guards as a last request .

A British woman , Elise Clifton-Ward ( Angelina Jolie ) , is being followed by French Police who are working with Scotland Yard under the direction of Inspector John Acheson ( Paul Bettany ) . Acheson has spent years hunting Alexander Pearce , a lover of Elise , who owes 744 million in back taxes , and is believed to have received plastic surgery to alter his appearance . At a Parisian cafe , Elise receives written instructions from Pearce : Board the train to Venice ; pick out a man ; let the police believe that he is Pearce . Elise burns the note , evades the police and boards the train . On the train , Elise selects Frank Tupelo ( Johnny Depp ) , who is apparently an American mathematics teacher from a community college in Wisconsin . She spends much time with him , seeming to start a romance . Meanwhile , the police have managed to salvage the ashes of her burned note and assembled them to extract information regarding her rendezvous , as well as her ruse . Aware of her location , but not of the ruse , an informer from the police station communicates to Reginald Shaw ( Steven Berkoff ) , the mobster from whom Pearce stole $ 2.3 billion , that Pearce is traveling with Elise on the train to Venice . Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice . Elise invites Frank to stay with her at her suite in the Hotel Danieli in Venice . Pearce leaves further instructions for Elise to attend a ball . Elise abandons Frank , who is then chased by Shaw s men . While trying to escape from them , Frank is detained by the Italian police , ostensibly for his own safety , only to have a corrupt inspector turn him over to Shaw s men in exchange for the bounty that has been placed on Pearce s head . Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over , leading Shaw s men on an extended boat chase and finally escaping . She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money , urging him to go home for his own safety . Elise is revealed to be an undercover Scotland Yard agent who was under suspension for her suspected sympathies with Pearce . She agrees to participate in a sting operation . At the ball , as Elise tries to spot Pearce in the crowd , an envelope is placed on the table in front of her , but the man ( Rufus Sewell ) disappears into the crowd . She tries to follow him through the crowd , but is stopped by Frank . Frank claims to be in love with Elise and invites her to dance with him . After the police surprise Frank , Elise reads the note . She leaves suddenly in her boat to be tailed by Shaw . Both parties are followed by the police . Frank is held handcuffed . When Elise arrives at the destination , Shaw takes her prisoner , threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of the stolen money . The police monitor the situation inside the rendezvous room through audio and video links . Despite Elise s peril , Acheson repeatedly turns down police requests to intervene with their snipers . While the police are occupied in monitoring the situation , Frank escapes from the police boat and confronts Shaw , claiming to be Pearce and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave safely . Shaw is skeptical and makes a counter offer that Frank should open the safe if he does not want to see Elise tortured by his men . Chief Inspector Jones ( Timothy Dalton ) arrives at the police stake-out , overrides Acheson , and orders the snipers to fire , killing Shaw and his men . To Elise s obvious pleasure , Jones lifts her suspension and terminates her employment . Acheson , receiving a message that Pearce has been found near their position , rushes to find the police have detained an Englishman . The man , Lawrence Mason , says he is a tourist following written instructions received via his mobile phone , for which he has been receiving payments . Elise tells Frank that she loves him , but she also loves Pearce . Frank then suggests a solution to this dilemma ; to Elise s surprise , he opens the safe by entering the correct code , thus revealing that he is really Alexander Pearce . When the police open the safe they find only one cheque : It is for 744 million . Acheson prepares to chase after Pearce , but Jones overrides him , reasoning that with the taxes now paid in full , Pearce s only crime is that he stole money from a now-dead gangster . Jones orders the case to be closed , much to Acheson s frustration . Frank ( Alexander ) and Elise sail away together .

A British woman , Elise Clifton-Ward ( Angelina Jolie ) , is being followed by French Police who are working with Scotland Yard under the direction of Inspector John Acheson ( Paul Bettany ) . Acheson has spent years hunting Alexander Pearce , a lover of Elise , who owes 744 million in back taxes , and is believed to have received plastic surgery to alter his appearance . At a Parisian cafe , Elise receives written instructions from Pearce : Board the train to Venice ; pick out a man ; let the police believe that he is Pearce . Elise burns the note , evades the police and boards the train . On the train , Elise selects Frank Tupelo ( Johnny Depp ) , who is apparently an American mathematics teacher from a community college in Wisconsin . She spends much time with him , seeming to start a romance . Meanwhile , the police have managed to salvage the ashes of her burned note and assembled them to extract information regarding her rendezvous , as well as her ruse . Aware of her location , but not of the ruse , an informer from the police station communicates to Reginald Shaw ( Steven Berkoff ) , the mobster from whom Pearce stole $ 2.3 billion , that Pearce is traveling with Elise on the train to Venice . Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice . Elise invites Frank to stay with her at her suite in the Hotel Danieli in Venice . Pearce leaves further instructions for Elise to attend a ball . Elise abandons Frank , who is then chased by Shaw s men . While trying to escape from them , Frank is detained by the Italian police , ostensibly for his own safety , only to have a corrupt inspector turn him over to Shaw s men in exchange for the bounty that has been placed on Pearce s head . Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over , leading Shaw s men on an extended boat chase and finally escaping . She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money , urging him to go home for his own safety . Elise is revealed to be an undercover Scotland Yard agent who was under suspension for her suspected sympathies with Pearce . She agrees to participate in a sting operation . At the ball , as Elise tries to spot Pearce in the crowd , an envelope is placed on the table in front of her , but the man ( Rufus Sewell ) disappears into the crowd . She tries to follow him through the crowd , but is stopped by Frank . Frank claims to be in love with Elise and invites her to dance with him . After the police surprise Frank , Elise reads the note . She leaves suddenly in her boat to be tailed by Shaw . Both parties are followed by the police . Frank is held handcuffed . When Elise arrives at the destination , Shaw takes her prisoner , threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of the stolen money . The police monitor the situation inside the rendezvous room through audio and video links . Despite Elise s peril , Acheson repeatedly turns down police requests to intervene with their snipers . While the police are occupied in monitoring the situation , Frank escapes from the police boat and confronts Shaw , claiming to be Pearce and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave safely . Shaw is skeptical and makes a counter offer that Frank should open the safe if he does not want to see Elise tortured by his men .

After saving New York City from the demi-god Gozer , the GhostbustersPeter Venkman , Egon Spengler , Ray Stantz , and Winston Zeddemorewere sued by several city and state agencies for the property damage . Rather than face financial ruin , they accepted a restraining order barring them from operating as paranormal investigators and eliminatorsforcing them out of business . In the eyes of the city , they are now considered frauds . Five years later , Ray owns an occult bookstore and works as an unpopular children s entertainer with Winston ; Egon has returned to Columbia University to conduct experiments into human emotion ; and Peter hosts a pseudo-psychic television show . Peter s former girlfriend Dana Barrett has had a son , Oscar , with a violinist whom she married then divorced when he received an offer to join the London Symphony Orchestra . In order to take care of her baby , Dana quit performing and now works as a restorer at the fictional Manhattan Museum of Art , working to prepare a malevolent-looking portrait of a legendary sixteenth-century tyrant named Vigo the Carpathian of Moldavia for an upcoming exhibition . After an incident in which Oscar s baby carriage is controlled by an unseen force and drawn to a busy intersection , Dana turns to the Ghostbusters for help . Meanwhile , Dana s colleague Dr. Janosz Poha has become increasingly obsessed with the glowering image of Vigo in the painting and falls under its spell . Vigo , whose spirit inhabits the painting , orders Janosz to locate a child that he can possess , allowing him to return to life on the New Year . Janosz , infatuated with Dana , offers to bring baby Oscar to Vigo in exchange for Dana , a deal which Vigo accepts . The Ghostbusters ' investigation leads them to illegally excavate First Avenue at the point where the baby carriage stopped . Lowered underneath , Ray discovers a vast river of pink slime filling an abandoned pneumatic transit line . Attacked by the slime after obtaining a sample , Ray causes a city-wide blackout by accidentally kicking a cast iron pipe that breaks , falls , and shorts out an electric cable . After this , the Ghostbusters are arrested by the NYPD . Ineffectually defended by Louis Tully , they are found guilty of violating the restraining order by Judge Wexler , aka The Hammer . Before they are taken to Riker s Island , Wexler angrily berates them . In response , the slime recovered by Ray and taken as evidence explodes , releasing the ghosts of two murderers that the judge had condemned to death that proceed to devastate the courtroom . The Ghostbusters capture the ghosts in return for the cancellation of the restraining order . Later , the slime invades Dana s apartment via the bathtub and attacks her and Oscar . She seeks refuge with Peter , and the two begin to renew their relationship . Investigating the psychomagnatheric ' slime and Vigo s history , the Ghostbusters discover that it reacts to emotions ; it can be charged positively or negatively . They suspect that it has been generated by the negative attitudes of New Yorkers . While Peter and Dana have dinner together , Egon , Ray , and Winston explore the underground river of slime . While measuring its depth , Winston gets pulled into the slime flow , and Ray and Egon jump in after him . After they escape back to the surface Ray and Winston begin an angry argument , but Egon realizes that they are being influenced by the slime , so they strip off their clothes . They also learn the river is flowing underground directly to the museum where Dana works . The Ghostbusters go to the mayor with their suspicions , but are dismissed ; the mayor s assistant , Jack Hardemeyer , has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor s campaign for governor . Meanwhile , a spirit resembling Janosz as a nanny kidnaps Oscar from Peter s apartment , and Dana pursues them to the museum alone . After she enters , the museum is covered with a cocoon of impenetrable slime . New Year s Eve sees a sudden increase of supernatural activity as the slime rises from the subway line and onto the city streets , causing widespread paranormal activity with ghosts attacking citizens . In response , the mayor fires Hardemeyer and has the Ghostbusters released . After heading to the museum , they are unable to breach the slime barrier with their proton packs . Determining that they need a powerful symbol to rally the citizens and weaken the slime , the Ghostbusters use positively charged mood slime and a remix of Higher and Higher to animate the Statue of Liberty and pilot it through the streets before the cheering crowds . As they arrive at the museum , the slime begins to recede and they use the Statue s flaming torch to break through a skylight to attack Vigo and Janosz . Janosz is neutralized with positively charged mood slime , but Vigo immobilizes the Ghostbusters and attempts to transfer into Oscar s body . The positive feelings accompanying a chorus of Auld Lang Syne by the citizens outside weakens Vigo , returning him to the painting and freeing the Ghostbusters . Vigo momentarily possesses Ray , and the other Ghostbusters attack him with a combination of proton streams and positively charged mood slime . This destroys Vigo and changes the painting to a likeness of the four Ghostbusters standing protectively around Oscar . Outside , the Ghostbusters receive a standing ovation from the crowd and , at a later ceremony to restore the Statue , the Key to the City from the mayor .

Tito learns from Fra Luca , a Dominican monk , that his adoptive father has been forced into slavery and is asking for assistance . Tito introspects , comparing filial duty to his new ambitions in Florence , and decides that it would be futile to attempt to rescue his adoptive father . This paves the way for Romola and Tito to marry . Fra Luca shortly thereafter falls ill and before his death he speaks to his estranged sister , Romola . Ignorant of Romola s plans , Fra Luca warns her of a vision foretelling a marriage between her and a mysterious stranger who will bring pain to her and her father . After Fra Luca s death , Tito dismisses the warning and advises Romola to trust him . Tito and Romola become betrothed at the end of Carnival , to be married at Easter after Tito returns from a visit to Rome . The novel then skips ahead to November 1494 , more than eighteen months after the marriage . In that time , the French-Italian Wars have seen Florence enter uneasy times . Girolamo Savonarola preaches to Florentines about ridding the Church and the city of scourge and corruption , and drums up support for the new republican government . Piero de ' Medici , Lorenzo de ' Medici s son and successor to the lordship of Florence , has been driven from the city for his ignominious surrender to the invading French king , Charles VIII . The Medici palace is looted and the Medici family formally exiled from the city . In this setting , Tito , now a valued member of Florentine society , participates in the reception for the French invaders . Tito encounters an escaped prisoner , who turns out to be his adopted father , Baldassarre . Panicked and somewhat ashamed of his earlier inaction , Tito denies knowing the escaped prisoner and calls him a madman . Baldassarre escapes into the Duomo , where he swears revenge on his unfilial adoptive son . Growing ever more fearful , Tito plans to leave Florence . To do this , he betrays his late father-in-law , Bardo , who died some months earlier , by selling the late scholar s library . This reveals to Romola the true nature of her husband s character . She secretly leaves Tito and Florence , but is persuaded by Savonarola to return to fulfil her obligations to her marriage and her fellow Florentines . Nevertheless , the love between Romola and Tito has gone . Again the action of the novel moves forward , from Christmas 1494 to October 1496 . In that time , Florence has endured political upheaval , warfare and famine . Religious fervour has swept through Florence under the leadership of Savonarola , culminating in the Bonfire of the Vanities . The League of Venice has declared war on the French king and his Italian ally , Florence . Starvation and disease run rampant through the city .

Mirroring this , he has escaped attempts by Baldassarre to both kill and expose him , and maintains a secret marriage to Tessa , with whom he has fathered two children . Romola becomes defiant of Tito , and the two manoeuvre to thwart each other s plans . Romola meets an enfeebled Baldassarre , who reveals Tito s past and leads her to Tessa .

Florence , 1492 : Christopher Columbus has sailed towards the New World , and Florence has just mourned the death of its legendary leader , Lorenzo de ' Medici . In this setting , a Florentine trader meets a shipwrecked stranger , who introduces himself as Tito Melema , a young Italianate-Greek scholar . Tito becomes acquainted with several other Florentines , including Nello the barber and a young girl named Tessa . He is also introduced to a blind scholar named Bardo de ' Bardi , and his daughter Romola . As Tito becomes settled in Florence , assisting Bardo with classical studies , he falls in love with Romola . However , Tessa falls in love with Tito , and the two are married in a mock ceremony . Tito learns from Fra Luca , a Dominican monk , that his adoptive father has been forced into slavery and is asking for assistance . Tito introspects , comparing filial duty to his new ambitions in Florence , and decides that it would be futile to attempt to rescue his adoptive father . This paves the way for Romola and Tito to marry . Fra Luca shortly thereafter falls ill and before his death he speaks to his estranged sister , Romola . Ignorant of Romola s plans , Fra Luca warns her of a vision foretelling a marriage between her and a mysterious stranger who will bring pain to her and her father . After Fra Luca s death , Tito dismisses the warning and advises Romola to trust him . Tito and Romola become betrothed at the end of Carnival , to be married at Easter after Tito returns from a visit to Rome . The novel then skips ahead to November 1494 , more than eighteen months after the marriage . In that time , the French-Italian Wars have seen Florence enter uneasy times . Girolamo Savonarola preaches to Florentines about ridding the Church and the city of scourge and corruption , and drums up support for the new republican government . Piero de ' Medici , Lorenzo de ' Medici s son and successor to the lordship of Florence , has been driven from the city for his ignominious surrender to the invading French king , Charles VIII . The Medici palace is looted and the Medici family formally exiled from the city . In this setting , Tito , now a valued member of Florentine society , participates in the reception for the French invaders . Tito encounters an escaped prisoner , who turns out to be his adopted father , Baldassarre . Panicked and somewhat ashamed of his earlier inaction , Tito denies knowing the escaped prisoner and calls him a madman . Baldassarre escapes into the Duomo , where he swears revenge on his unfilial adoptive son . Growing ever more fearful , Tito plans to leave Florence . To do this , he betrays his late father-in-law , Bardo , who died some months earlier , by selling the late scholar s library . This reveals to Romola the true nature of her husband s character . She secretly leaves Tito and Florence , but is persuaded by Savonarola to return to fulfil her obligations to her marriage and her fellow Florentines . Nevertheless , the love between Romola and Tito has gone . Again the action of the novel moves forward , from Christmas 1494 to October 1496 . In that time , Florence has endured political upheaval , warfare and famine . Religious fervour has swept through Florence under the leadership of Savonarola , culminating in the Bonfire of the Vanities . The League of Venice has declared war on the French king and his Italian ally , Florence . Starvation and disease run rampant through the city . Romola , now a supporter of Savonarola , helps the poor and sick where she can . Meanwhile , Tito is embroiled in a complex game of political manoeuvring and duplicitous allegiances in the new Florentine government . Mirroring this , he has escaped attempts by Baldassarre to both kill and expose him , and maintains a secret marriage to Tessa , with whom he has fathered two children . Romola becomes defiant of Tito , and the two manoeuvre to thwart each other s plans . Romola meets an enfeebled Baldassarre , who reveals Tito s past and leads her to Tessa . Political turmoil erupts in Florence . Five supporters of the Medici family are sentenced to death , including Romola s godfather , Bernardo del Nero . She learns that Tito has played a role in their arrest . Romola pleads with Savonarola to intervene , but he refuses . Romola s faith in Savonarola and Florence is shaken , and once again she leaves the city . Meanwhile , Florence is under papal pressure to expel Savonarola .

Pierre Grassou de Fougres is a mediocre painter who lives off painting forgeries commissioned by an old swindler and art-dealer named Elias Magus . Grassou paints forgeries of works by Titian , Raphael , and other famous artists . Magus resells these forgeries for a large profit to members of the Petite bourgeoisie who are incapable of appreciating good art . Monsieur Vervelle , a prosperous bottle-dealer obsessed with art , is introduced to Grassou by Magus , who introduces the painter as a grand master . Vervelle and his wife are enchanted with Grassou and believe he would make a good match for their daughter Virginie . Grassou is invited to Ville-d'Avray , where the Vervelle mansion is garishly decorated , and also includes a large collection of Grassous work , including the forgery of a Titian . Grassou recognizes his own mediocrity , but when it is discovered by the Vervelles that the forgeries in their home were painted by Grassou , far from denting his reputation , multiples Grassous value as an artist and as a son-in-law , since Vervelle believes Grassou to possess all the combined talent of Rubens , Rembrandt , Terburg , and Titian . Despite his advantageous marriage , Grassou remains bitter that he is not a true artist . This painter , a good father and a good husband , is unable to eradicate from his heart a fatal thought , namely , that artists laugh at his work ; that his name is a term of contempt in the studios ; and that the feuilletons take no notice of his pictures . But he still works on ; he aims for the Academy , where , undoubtedly , he will enter .

Kate and John Coleman ( Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard ) are experiencing strains in their marriage after their third child is stillborn . The loss is particularly hard on Kate , who is also recovering from alcoholism . The couple decides to adopt a 9-year-old Russian girl named Esther ( Isabelle Fuhrman ) from a local orphanage . While Kate and John s deaf daughter Max ( Aryana Engineer ) embraces Esther immediately , their son Daniel ( Jimmy Bennett ) is less welcoming . Kate suspects that there might be problems in Esther s background when Esther s knowledge of sex extends beyond her age . Her suspicions deepen when Esther injures another girl who had bullied her at school . Kate is further alarmed when Sister Abigail ( C. C. H. Pounder ) , the head of the orphanage , warns her that bad things happen when Esther is around . Esther overhears this and plots to use Max to distract Sister Abigail and then kill her . Esther pushes Max into the path of Sister Abigail s car , forcing her to swerve off the road . Esther then kills Sister Abigail with a hammer , and forces Max to help her hide the weapon in their tree house . Kate is convinced that something is very wrong with Esther , but John does not believe her . Kate finds Esther s hidden Bible and discovers that it came from the Saarne Institute in Estonia , a mental hospital . She emails a picture of Esther to them and asks for more information . When Daniel learns about Sister Abigail s death , he tells Max of his plan to retrieve the hammer to prove Esther s guilt . Esther overhears this and confronts Daniel at the tree house , then sets it ablaze to kill him and destroy the evidence . Daniel falls from the tree trying to escape , and is knocked unconscious . Esther attempts to finish him off , but Max stops her . While Daniel is hospitalized , Esther slips into his room and smothers him with a pillow , stopping his heart ; doctors quickly revive him . Kate realizes what happened and attacks Esther but is restrained and sedated . That night , a provocatively-dressed Esther tries to seduce a drunken John , who finally realizes Kate was right . He tells Esther that her future with the Coleman s is at stake , upsetting her . Kate receives a call from Dr. Vrava ( Karel Roden ) , the director of the Saarne Institute , who reveals that Esther is actually a 33-year-old woman named Leena Klammer , who has hypopituitarism , a hormone disorder that stunted her physical growth , and that she has spent most of her life posing as a little girl and had people adopt her , with the goal of seducing the father and having a sexual relationship with him . The doctor reports that Leena has murdered at least seven people . The previous family she was adopted by was killed by her because the father had rejected her sexual advances . Kate tries to get back home to stop Esther and prevent her family from suffering the same fate . Leena flies into a rage after being spurned by John , and ransacks her room , removing her little girl makeup , revealing the scars from a straitjacket and weathered skin . Leena stabs and kills John . Max witnesses this and hides . Kate rushes home and finds John dead . Leena gets a gun from John s safe and shoots Kate in the arm . Kate manages to take the gun and flee with Max . Leena finds Kate and Max near a frozen pond . She lunges at Kate , hurling them both into the ice . Kate climbs partially out of the pond ; Leena , reverting to her Esther persona , begs Kate not to let her die while hiding a knife behind her back . Kate kills Leena by kicking her in the face , breaking her neck . Max and Kate are met by the police moments after .

Kate and John Coleman ( Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard ) are experiencing strains in their marriage after their third child is stillborn . The loss is particularly hard on Kate , who is also recovering from alcoholism . The couple decides to adopt a 9-year-old Russian girl named Esther ( Isabelle Fuhrman ) from a local orphanage . While Kate and John s deaf daughter Max ( Aryana Engineer ) embraces Esther immediately , their son Daniel ( Jimmy Bennett ) is less welcoming . Kate suspects that there might be problems in Esther s background when Esther s knowledge of sex extends beyond her age . Her suspicions deepen when Esther injures another girl who had bullied her at school . Kate is further alarmed when Sister Abigail ( C. C. H. Pounder ) , the head of the orphanage , warns her that bad things happen when Esther is around . Esther overhears this and plots to use Max to distract Sister Abigail and then kill her . Esther pushes Max into the path of Sister Abigail s car , forcing her to swerve off the road . Esther then kills Sister Abigail with a hammer , and forces Max to help her hide the weapon in their tree house .

( From Conan The Warrior , ISBN 0-441-11465-2 ) The foreword to the story tells of his travels to Punt with Muriela , refers to a scam perpetrated against worshippers of an ivory goddess and then on to Zembabwei , where he joins a trading caravan on its way to Shem . Around 40 now , Conan visits his homeland and finds his old friends are fathers . Bored , Conan sets off for the Bossonian Marches and becomes a Scout at Fort Tuscelan on the Black River . Naturally , there is a war going on ... A young settler named Balthus encounters Conan in the forests slaying a forest devil . Accompanying the young man back to the Fort , Conan finds the body of a merchant ensorcelled by a Pictish wizard named Zogar Sag and slain by a swamp demon . The Fort Tuscelan Commander , Valannus , is a desperate man and asks Conan to slay Zogar Sag before he raises the Picts against the whole borderlands . Taking a hand picked team of scouts and Balthus , Conan sets off stealthily in canoes . Balthus is captured and most of Conan s men slaughtered in an ambush . Balthus and one of the Scouts are tied to stakes and the scout is sacrificed by Zogar Sag to one of his jungle creatures . Before Balthus can meet a similar fate , Conan sets the Pictish village on fire and the two flee into the woods . Conan tells Balthus of the cult of Jhebbal Sag , now forgotten by most . Once all living things worshipped him when men and beasts spoke the same language . Over time men and most beasts forgot his worship . Zogar Sag has not , however , and can control those few animals and creatures who also remember . And they are on Conan s trail now . Conan is able to neutralize them using a symbol he once noticed , and the pair hurry to return to the Fort to warn them of the impending Pictish assault , but they are too late . The Picts already are all around the fort , and furious fighting is going on . The number of Picts ensures that eventually the fort will be overwhelmed and the defenders slaughtered . The only thing left to do is warn the settlers to flee while the Picts are busy with the fort - otherwise they will be slaughtered , too . Conan and Balthus go to warn the settlers that the Picts have crossed the river and are raiding . They are joined by Slasher , a feral dog formerly owned by a settler who had been slain by the Picts . Balthus is sent on to warn settlers of the coming Pict raid , and Conan parts from him to warn a group of settler who had gone to gather salt . Balthus warns women and children to leave their huts and flee . When a band of Picts arrives , who move quicker and might overtake the women , Balthus stays behind to cover their escape . Accompanied by Slasher he makes a stand against the coming Pict raiders , first shooting arrows from concealment and then in a furious face to face battle . The man and dog s sacrifice delays the Picts and gives the settlers time to reach safety . Conan manages to warn the salt-gathering party in time , but finds he has been marked for death by the gods of darkness for misusing the symbol of Jhebbal Sag . In the end Conan triumphs , but the fort is lost , and so is the entire province . The story ends in a tavern . A survivor tells Conan about the courageous act of Balthus and Slasher , and how their final stand had delayed the Picts just barely long enough for the settlers to reach safety . Upon hearing of the fight , Conan vowed to take the heads of ten Picts to pay for Balthus ' sacrifice , along with seven heads for the dog , who was a better warrior than many a man .

Before Balthus can meet a similar fate , Conan sets the Pictish village on fire and the two flee into the woods . Conan tells Balthus of the cult of Jhebbal Sag , now forgotten by most . Once all living things worshipped him when men and beasts spoke the same language . Over time men and most beasts forgot his worship . Zogar Sag has not , however , and can control those few animals and creatures who also remember . And they are on Conan s trail now . Conan is able to neutralize them using a symbol he once noticed , and the pair hurry to return to the Fort to warn them of the impending Pictish assault , but they are too late . The Picts already are all around the fort , and furious fighting is going on . The number of Picts ensures that eventually the fort will be overwhelmed and the defenders slaughtered . The only thing left to do is warn the settlers to flee while the Picts are busy with the fort - otherwise they will be slaughtered , too . Conan and Balthus go to warn the settlers that the Picts have crossed the river and are raiding . They are joined by Slasher , a feral dog formerly owned by a settler who had been slain by the Picts . Balthus is sent on to warn settlers of the coming Pict raid , and Conan parts from him to warn a group of settler who had gone to gather salt . Balthus warns women and children to leave their huts and flee . When a band of Picts arrives , who move quicker and might overtake the women , Balthus stays behind to cover their escape . Accompanied by Slasher he makes a stand against the coming Pict raiders , first shooting arrows from concealment and then in a furious face to face battle . The man and dog s sacrifice delays the Picts and gives the settlers time to reach safety . Conan manages to warn the salt-gathering party in time , but finds he has been marked for death by the gods of darkness for misusing the symbol of Jhebbal Sag . In the end Conan triumphs , but the fort is lost , and so is the entire province . The story ends in a tavern . A survivor tells Conan about the courageous act of Balthus and Slasher , and how their final stand had delayed the Picts just barely long enough for the settlers to reach safety . Upon hearing of the fight , Conan vowed to take the heads of ten Picts to pay for Balthus ' sacrifice , along with seven heads for the dog , who was a better warrior than many a man .

In 1585 , Catholic Spain ruled by King Philip II of Spain ( Jordi Molla ) is the most powerful country in the world . Seeing Protestant England as a threat , and in retaliation for English piracy of Spanish ships , Philip declares war . He plans to take over England and make his daughter , Isabella , the Queen of England in Elizabeth s place . Meanwhile , Elizabeth I of England ( Cate Blanchett ) is being pressured by her advisor , Francis Walsingham ( Geoffrey Rush ) , to marry , for if she dies without an heir , the throne will pass to her cousin , Mary , Queen of Scots ( Samantha Morton ) , who is Catholic . Therefore , the Queen is presented with portraits of appropriate suitors , particularly the very youthful Charles II , Archduke of Austria ( Christian Brassington ) , who has become infatuated with the her . However , she refuses to marry any of them . English explorer Walter Raleigh ( Clive Owen ) is presented at Elizabeth s court , having returned from the New World , and he offers her potatoes , tobacco , two Native Americans , and gold from a Spanish ship that he claims was unable to continue its journey . Elizabeth commands that the Native Americans be treated well and refuses to accept the gold . Elizabeth is attracted to Raleigh , enthralled by his tales of exploration , and asks Bess Throckmorton ( Abbie Cornish ) , her most favored lady-in-waiting , to observe him . Bess also finds Raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him . Elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer , Dr. John Dee ( David Threlfall ) , who predicts that two empires will go to war . However , he can not predict which will triumph over the other , leaving Elizabeth to ponder her and England s fate . Jesuits in London conspire with Philip to assassinate Elizabeth and replace her with Mary , in what Philip calls The English Enterprise , historically known as the Babington Plot . From her imprisonment , Mary sends secret correspondence to the Jesuits , who recruit Anthony Babington ( Eddie Redmayne ) to assassinate Elizabeth . Walsingham continues to warn Elizabeth of Spain s rising power and of the Catholics ' plots against her . However she , unlike her predecessor and half-sister Mary I of England , refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs . Even so , those conspiring against Elizabeth are being hunted and murdered , including Bess s cousin , Sir Francis Throckmorton and his father , whom Bess had failed to protect . After learning of her cousin s torture and death at Walsingham s hands , Bess turns to Raleigh for comfort . Walsingham s brother , a Papist , who knows of the plot against Elizabeth is jailed . Walsingham reveals Spain s plot to Elizabeth , who angrily confronts the Spanish diplomats . The Spanish ambassador feigns ignorance , accuses Elizabeth of receiving Spanish gold from pirates , and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with Raleigh . In response , a sword fight nearly ensues between the Queen s male escorts and the Spanish contingent , and Elizabeth throws the Spaniards out of court . Meanwhile , Philip is cutting down the forests of Spain to build the Spanish Armada , to invade England . Mary writes letters condoning the plot . Babington storms into a cathedral where Elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her . Elizabeth opens her arms , seemingly fearless . He pulls the trigger , and the gun fires . At first Walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless , though it is later revealed by the traitor , in the torture chamber , that there was no bullet in the gun . Elizabeth learns of Mary s involvement in the plot , and Walsingham insists Mary be executed to quell any possible revolt . Elizabeth is reluctant , but nevertheless agrees . Mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded , after ascending the block in a blood-red dress ( red being the Catholic liturgical color for martyrs ) . Walsingham sees that this was part of the Jesuits ' plan all along . Philip had never intended Mary to become queen , but since the Pope and other Catholic leaders regarded Mary as the true Queen of England , Philip uses Mary s death to obtain papal approval for war . The murder of the last legitimate Catholic in the line of succession gives Philip the pretext he needs to invade England and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch , and he oversees the departure of the Armada from Cdiz . In England , Raleigh asks to leave for the New World , which Elizabeth forbids , instead knighting him and making him Captain of the Royal Guard . Bess discovers she is pregnant with Raleigh s child , and after telling him the news , she pleads with him to leave . He chooses not to , and the couple marries in secret . Elizabeth confronts Bess a few weeks later ; Bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with Raleigh s child , and that Raleigh is her husband . An enraged Elizabeth berates Bess , reminding her that she can not marry without royal consent . Feeling betrayed , the queen banishes Bess from court and has Raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the Queen . Walsingham arranges for his brother William to be released and taken to France , on the condition that he must never return to England . The Armada begins its approach up the English Channel , and Elizabeth forgives Bess and sets Raleigh free to join Sir Francis Drake in the battle . Elizabeth gives her Speech to the Troops at Tilbury , while seated on a war horse and wearing full plate armour . The ships of the Armada vastly outnumber England s , but at the last moment , a major storm blows the Armada toward the beaches , endangering its formation and ships . The ships of the Armada drop anchor , and the Armada becomes a sitting duck for English fire ships . Elizabeth , back at her coastal headquarters , walks out to the cliffs and watches the Spanish Armada sink in flames . Elizabeth visits Walsingham on his deathbed and tells her old friend to rest . She then visits Raleigh and Bess and blesses their child . Elizabeth seemingly triumphs personally through her ordeal , again resigned to her role as the Virgin Queen and mother to the English people .

In 1585 , Catholic Spain ruled by King Philip II of Spain ( Jordi Molla ) is the most powerful country in the world . Seeing Protestant England as a threat , and in retaliation for English piracy of Spanish ships , Philip declares war . He plans to take over England and make his daughter , Isabella , the Queen of England in Elizabeth s place . Meanwhile , Elizabeth I of England ( Cate Blanchett ) is being pressured by her advisor , Francis Walsingham ( Geoffrey Rush ) , to marry , for if she dies without an heir , the throne will pass to her cousin , Mary , Queen of Scots ( Samantha Morton ) , who is Catholic . Therefore , the Queen is presented with portraits of appropriate suitors , particularly the very youthful Charles II , Archduke of Austria ( Christian Brassington ) , who has become infatuated with the her . However , she refuses to marry any of them . English explorer Walter Raleigh ( Clive Owen ) is presented at Elizabeth s court , having returned from the New World , and he offers her potatoes , tobacco , two Native Americans , and gold from a Spanish ship that he claims was unable to continue its journey . Elizabeth commands that the Native Americans be treated well and refuses to accept the gold . Elizabeth is attracted to Raleigh , enthralled by his tales of exploration , and asks Bess Throckmorton ( Abbie Cornish ) , her most favored lady-in-waiting , to observe him . Bess also finds Raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him . Elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer , Dr. John Dee ( David Threlfall ) , who predicts that two empires will go to war . However , he can not predict which will triumph over the other , leaving Elizabeth to ponder her and England s fate . Jesuits in London conspire with Philip to assassinate Elizabeth and replace her with Mary , in what Philip calls The English Enterprise , historically known as the Babington Plot . From her imprisonment , Mary sends secret correspondence to the Jesuits , who recruit Anthony Babington ( Eddie Redmayne ) to assassinate Elizabeth . Walsingham continues to warn Elizabeth of Spain s rising power and of the Catholics ' plots against her . However she , unlike her predecessor and half-sister Mary I of England , refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs . Even so , those conspiring against Elizabeth are being hunted and murdered , including Bess s cousin , Sir Francis Throckmorton and his father , whom Bess had failed to protect . After learning of her cousin s torture and death at Walsingham s hands , Bess turns to Raleigh for comfort . Walsingham s brother , a Papist , who knows of the plot against Elizabeth is jailed . Walsingham reveals Spain s plot to Elizabeth , who angrily confronts the Spanish diplomats . The Spanish ambassador feigns ignorance , accuses Elizabeth of receiving Spanish gold from pirates , and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with Raleigh . In response , a sword fight nearly ensues between the Queen s male escorts and the Spanish contingent , and Elizabeth throws the Spaniards out of court . Meanwhile , Philip is cutting down the forests of Spain to build the Spanish Armada , to invade England . Mary writes letters condoning the plot . Babington storms into a cathedral where Elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her . Elizabeth opens her arms , seemingly fearless . He pulls the trigger , and the gun fires . At first Walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless , though it is later revealed by the traitor , in the torture chamber , that there was no bullet in the gun . Elizabeth learns of Mary s involvement in the plot , and Walsingham insists Mary be executed to quell any possible revolt . Elizabeth is reluctant , but nevertheless agrees . Mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded , after ascending the block in a blood-red dress ( red being the Catholic liturgical color for martyrs ) . Walsingham sees that this was part of the Jesuits ' plan all along . Philip had never intended Mary to become queen , but since the Pope and other Catholic leaders regarded Mary as the true Queen of England , Philip uses Mary s death to obtain papal approval for war . The murder of the last legitimate Catholic in the line of succession gives Philip the pretext he needs to invade England and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch , and he oversees the departure of the Armada from Cdiz . In England , Raleigh asks to leave for the New World , which Elizabeth forbids , instead knighting him and making him Captain of the Royal Guard . Bess discovers she is pregnant with Raleigh s child , and after telling him the news , she pleads with him to leave . He chooses not to , and the couple marries in secret . Elizabeth confronts Bess a few weeks later ; Bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with Raleigh s child , and that Raleigh is her husband . An enraged Elizabeth berates Bess , reminding her that she can not marry without royal consent . Feeling betrayed , the queen banishes Bess from court and has Raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the Queen . Walsingham arranges for his brother William to be released and taken to France , on the condition that he must never return to England . The Armada begins its approach up the English Channel , and Elizabeth forgives Bess and sets Raleigh free to join Sir Francis Drake in the battle . Elizabeth gives her Speech to the Troops at Tilbury , while seated on a war horse and wearing full plate armour . The ships of the Armada vastly outnumber England s , but at the last moment , a major storm blows the Armada toward the beaches , endangering its formation and ships .

Elizabeth is attracted to Raleigh , enthralled by his tales of exploration , and asks Bess Throckmorton ( Abbie Cornish ) , her most favored lady-in-waiting , to observe him . Bess also finds Raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him . Elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer , Dr. John Dee ( David Threlfall ) , who predicts that two empires will go to war . However , he can not predict which will triumph over the other , leaving Elizabeth to ponder her and England s fate . Jesuits in London conspire with Philip to assassinate Elizabeth and replace her with Mary , in what Philip calls The English Enterprise , historically known as the Babington Plot . From her imprisonment , Mary sends secret correspondence to the Jesuits , who recruit Anthony Babington ( Eddie Redmayne ) to assassinate Elizabeth . Walsingham continues to warn Elizabeth of Spain s rising power and of the Catholics ' plots against her . However she , unlike her predecessor and half-sister Mary I of England , refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs . Even so , those conspiring against Elizabeth are being hunted and murdered , including Bess s cousin , Sir Francis Throckmorton and his father , whom Bess had failed to protect . After learning of her cousin s torture and death at Walsingham s hands , Bess turns to Raleigh for comfort . Walsingham s brother , a Papist , who knows of the plot against Elizabeth is jailed . Walsingham reveals Spain s plot to Elizabeth , who angrily confronts the Spanish diplomats . The Spanish ambassador feigns ignorance , accuses Elizabeth of receiving Spanish gold from pirates , and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with Raleigh . In response , a sword fight nearly ensues between the Queen s male escorts and the Spanish contingent , and Elizabeth throws the Spaniards out of court . Meanwhile , Philip is cutting down the forests of Spain to build the Spanish Armada , to invade England . Mary writes letters condoning the plot . Babington storms into a cathedral where Elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her . Elizabeth opens her arms , seemingly fearless . He pulls the trigger , and the gun fires . At first Walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless , though it is later revealed by the traitor , in the torture chamber , that there was no bullet in the gun . Elizabeth learns of Mary s involvement in the plot , and Walsingham insists Mary be executed to quell any possible revolt . Elizabeth is reluctant , but nevertheless agrees . Mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded , after ascending the block in a blood-red dress ( red being the Catholic liturgical color for martyrs ) . Walsingham sees that this was part of the Jesuits ' plan all along . Philip had never intended Mary to become queen , but since the Pope and other Catholic leaders regarded Mary as the true Queen of England , Philip uses Mary s death to obtain papal approval for war . The murder of the last legitimate Catholic in the line of succession gives Philip the pretext he needs to invade England and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch , and he oversees the departure of the Armada from Cdiz . In England , Raleigh asks to leave for the New World , which Elizabeth forbids , instead knighting him and making him Captain of the Royal Guard . Bess discovers she is pregnant with Raleigh s child , and after telling him the news , she pleads with him to leave . He chooses not to , and the couple marries in secret . Elizabeth confronts Bess a few weeks later ; Bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with Raleigh s child , and that Raleigh is her husband . An enraged Elizabeth berates Bess , reminding her that she can not marry without royal consent . Feeling betrayed , the queen banishes Bess from court and has Raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the Queen . Walsingham arranges for his brother William to be released and taken to France , on the condition that he must never return to England . The Armada begins its approach up the English Channel , and Elizabeth forgives Bess and sets Raleigh free to join Sir Francis Drake in the battle . Elizabeth gives her Speech to the Troops at Tilbury , while seated on a war horse and wearing full plate armour . The ships of the Armada vastly outnumber England s , but at the last moment , a major storm blows the Armada toward the beaches , endangering its formation and ships . The ships of the Armada drop anchor , and the Armada becomes a sitting duck for English fire ships . Elizabeth , back at her coastal headquarters , walks out to the cliffs and watches the Spanish Armada sink in flames . Elizabeth visits Walsingham on his deathbed and tells her old friend to rest . She then visits Raleigh and Bess and blesses their child . Elizabeth seemingly triumphs personally through her ordeal , again resigned to her role as the Virgin Queen and mother to the English people .

Mary begins with a description of the conventional and loveless marriage between the heroine s mother and father . Eliza , Mary s mother , is obsessed with novels , rarely considers anyone but herself , and favours Mary s brother . She neglects her daughter , who educates herself using only books and the natural world . Ignored by her family , Mary devotes much of her time to charity . When her brother suddenly dies , leaving Mary heir to the family s fortune , her mother finally takes an interest in her ; she is taught accomplishments , such as dancing , that will attract suitors . However , Mary s mother soon sickens and requests on her deathbed that Mary wed Charles , a wealthy man she has never met . Stunned and unable to refuse , Mary agrees . Immediately after the ceremony , Charles departs for the Continent . To escape a family who does not share her values , Mary befriends Ann , a local girl who educates her still further . Mary becomes quite attached to Ann who is in the grip of an unrequited love and does not reciprocate Mary s feelings . Ann s family falls into poverty and is on the brink of losing their home , but Mary is able to pay off their debts after her marriage to Charles gives her limited control over her money . Ann becomes consumptive and Mary travels with her to Lisbon in hopes of nursing her back to health . There they are introduced to Henry , who is also trying to regain his health . Ann dies and Mary is grief-stricken . Henry and Mary subsequently fall in love but are forced to return to England separately . Mary , depressed by her marriage to Charles and bereft of both Ann and Henry , remains unsettled , until she hears that Henry s consumption has worsened . She rushes to his side and cares for him until he dies . At the end of the novel , Charles returns from Europe ; he and Mary establish something of a life together , but Mary is unhealthy and can barely stand to be in the same room with her husband ; the last few lines of the novel imply that she will die young .

Launched in 1977 , the Voyager 2 space probe carried a gold phonographic disk with a message of peace , inviting alien civilizations to visit Earth . The probe is intercepted by an alien ship which then sends a small scout vessel to establish first contact with Earth . However , instead of greeting the alien craft , the US government shoots it down . Crashing in Chequamegon Bay , Wisconsin , the lone alien occupant , looking like a floating ball of glowing energy , finds the home of recently widowed Jenny Hayden ( Karen Allen ) . While there , the alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband , Scott , to clone a new body for himself as a terrified Jenny watches . The alien Starman ( Jeff Bridges ) has seven small silver spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats . He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his spacecraft has been destroyed . He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days ' time . He then uses the second sphere to create a holographic map of the United States , coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous point in Arizona . Jenny is initially both hostile and frightened of him and attempts to escape . Having a rough understanding of English language from the Voyager 2 disk , the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm . He explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point , Arizona s Barringer Crater , in three days , he will die . Sympathetic but still wary , Jenny teaches him how to drive a car and use credit cards so he can continue the journey alone , but when she witnesses him miraculously resurrect a dead deer , she is deeply moved and decides to stay with him . However , they are pursued across the country by the authorities and , after nearly being caught , Jenny is shot and critically wounded by a police officer . In order to escape , the Starman crashes their car into a gas tanker and uses another sphere to protect the two of them from the explosion . They take refuge in a mobile home that is being towed . He uses another silver sphere to heal Jenny . After being assured that Jenny will recover , the Starman proceeds to hitchhike towards Arizona without her , but Jenny manages to catch up to him while he and his driver are stopped at a roadblock . Reunited , the two of them hitchhike together , resuming their journey towards the crater . Later , while stowing away on a boxcar train , the couple makes love . The Starman tells Jenny I gave you a baby tonight . Jenny explains that she is infertile and can not have children , but he assures her she is now pregnant . He explains that the baby will be the son of her dead husband , because he ( Starman ) is a clone of Scott , but as a child of Starman as well , their son will possess all of the Starman s knowledge and will grow up to be a teacher . Starman offers to stop the pregnancy if she wishes , but the joyful Jenny embraces him , accepting the gift . The couple mistakenly travel too far on the train and arrive in Las Vegas . Jenny realizes she has lost her wallet . The Starman uses one of their last quarters in a slot machine , which he manipulates in order to win the $ 500,000 jackpot . They then buy a new car to complete their journey to Arizona . Meanwhile , National Security Agency director George Fox learns that the Starman s flight trajectory , prior to being shot down , was to the Barringer Crater . Fox arranges to have the Starman captured by the Army , dead or alive . SETI scientist Mark Shermin , another government official involved in the case , criticizes Fox s heavy-handed approach and reminds him that the Starman was invited to Earth . Appalled to learn that Fox is planning to vivisect the alien , Shermin then resolves to help the Starman escape rather than allow Fox to capture him . Jenny and the now dying Starman reach the crater as Army helicopters pursue them . Just as they are surrounded , a large , spherical spaceship appears and descends into the crater . Light surrounds the couple , and the Starman is instantly restored to health . As he prepares to leave , he tells Jenny he will never see her again . Jenny begs him to take her with him , but he says she would die on his world . He then gives her his last silver sphere , telling her that their son will know what to do with it . Jenny watches as the ship departs .


Launched in 1977 , the Voyager 2 space probe carried a gold phonographic disk with a message of peace , inviting alien civilizations to visit Earth . The probe is intercepted by an alien ship which then sends a small scout vessel to establish first contact with Earth . However , instead of greeting the alien craft , the US government shoots it down . Crashing in Chequamegon Bay , Wisconsin , the lone alien occupant , looking like a floating ball of glowing energy , finds the home of recently widowed Jenny Hayden ( Karen Allen ) . While there , the alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband , Scott , to clone a new body for himself as a terrified Jenny watches . The alien Starman ( Jeff Bridges ) has seven small silver spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats . He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his spacecraft has been destroyed . He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days ' time . He then uses the second sphere to create a holographic map of the United States , coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous point in Arizona . Jenny is initially both hostile and frightened of him and attempts to escape . Having a rough understanding of English language from the Voyager 2 disk , the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm . He explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point , Arizona s Barringer Crater , in three days , he will die . Sympathetic but still wary , Jenny teaches him how to drive a car and use credit cards so he can continue the journey alone , but when she witnesses him miraculously resurrect a dead deer , she is deeply moved and decides to stay with him . However , they are pursued across the country by the authorities and , after nearly being caught , Jenny is shot and critically wounded by a police officer . In order to escape , the Starman crashes their car into a gas tanker and uses another sphere to protect the two of them from the explosion . They take refuge in a mobile home that is being towed . He uses another silver sphere to heal Jenny . After being assured that Jenny will recover , the Starman proceeds to hitchhike towards Arizona without her , but Jenny manages to catch up to him while he and his driver are stopped at a roadblock .

The novel revolves around Montgomery Brewster , a young man who inherits one million dollars from his rich grandfather . Shortly after , a rich and eccentric uncle who hated Brewster s grandfather ( a long-held grudge stemming from the grandfather s disapproval of the marriage of Brewster s parents ) also dies . The uncle will leave Brewster seven million dollars , but only under the condition that he keeps none of the grandfather s money . Brewster is required to spend every penny of his grandfather s million within one year , resulting in no assets or property held from the wealth at the end of that time . If Brewster meets these terms , he will gain the full seven million ; if he fails , he remains penniless . Brewster finds that spending so much money within the course of a year is incredibly difficult under the strict conditions imposed by his uncle s will . Brewster is required to demonstrate business sense by obtaining good value for the money he spends , limiting his donations to charity , his losses to gambling , and the value of his tips to waiters and cab drivers . Moreover , Brewster is sworn to secrecy , and can not tell anyone why he is living to excess . Working against him are his well-meaning friends , who try repeatedly to limit his losses and extravagance even as they share in his luxurious lifestyle . Brewster s challenge is compounded by the fact that his attempts to lose money through stock speculation and roulette prove to increase his funds rather than decrease them . He throws large parties and balls , and charters a cruise lasting several months to Europe and Egypt for his large circle of friends and employees ; the press lampoons him as a spendthrift . Despite his loose purse strings , Brewster repeatedly demonstrates a strong moral character . At one point , he uses his funds to bail out a bank to save his landlady s account , despite risking his eligibility for the will . At another , he jumps overboard to save a drowning sailor from his cruise even as his rich friends choose not to . Monty s would-be wife Barbara Drew turns down his marriage proposal early in the year , believing him to be financially irresponsible and bound to a life of poverty , and his attempts to win her back repeatedly fail as Monty s attention is entirely absorbed by the requirement to spend so much money . At the conclusion of the year , Monty succeeds in spending the last of his funds , which he has meticulously documented , and confesses his love to another woman , Peggy Gray , who has been sympathetic to his lifestyle despite knowing nothing about his challenge . Tragedy strikes the night before Monty s deadline , as his lawyers inform him that the executor of his uncle s will has vanished after liquidating all of the assets . Monty convinces himself that he is doomed to poverty , but marries Peggy Gray , who accepts him despite the lack of wealth . Shortly after the wedding , the executor of his uncle s will arrives to inform him that he has successfully met the challenge and that he has come to deliver the money to Monty in person .

Monty s would-be wife Barbara Drew turns down his marriage proposal early in the year , believing him to be financially irresponsible and bound to a life of poverty , and his attempts to win her back repeatedly fail as Monty s attention is entirely absorbed by the requirement to spend so much money . At the conclusion of the year , Monty succeeds in spending the last of his funds , which he has meticulously documented , and confesses his love to another woman , Peggy Gray , who has been sympathetic to his lifestyle despite knowing nothing about his challenge . Tragedy strikes the night before Monty s deadline , as his lawyers inform him that the executor of his uncle s will has vanished after liquidating all of the assets . Monty convinces himself that he is doomed to poverty , but marries Peggy Gray , who accepts him despite the lack of wealth .

The novel revolves around Montgomery Brewster , a young man who inherits one million dollars from his rich grandfather . Shortly after , a rich and eccentric uncle who hated Brewster s grandfather ( a long-held grudge stemming from the grandfather s disapproval of the marriage of Brewster s parents ) also dies . The uncle will leave Brewster seven million dollars , but only under the condition that he keeps none of the grandfather s money . Brewster is required to spend every penny of his grandfather s million within one year , resulting in no assets or property held from the wealth at the end of that time . If Brewster meets these terms , he will gain the full seven million ; if he fails , he remains penniless . Brewster finds that spending so much money within the course of a year is incredibly difficult under the strict conditions imposed by his uncle s will . Brewster is required to demonstrate business sense by obtaining good value for the money he spends , limiting his donations to charity , his losses to gambling , and the value of his tips to waiters and cab drivers . Moreover , Brewster is sworn to secrecy , and can not tell anyone why he is living to excess . Working against him are his well-meaning friends , who try repeatedly to limit his losses and extravagance even as they share in his luxurious lifestyle . Brewster s challenge is compounded by the fact that his attempts to lose money through stock speculation and roulette prove to increase his funds rather than decrease them . He throws large parties and balls , and charters a cruise lasting several months to Europe and Egypt for his large circle of friends and employees ; the press lampoons him as a spendthrift . Despite his loose purse strings , Brewster repeatedly demonstrates a strong moral character .

Calchas , a soothsayer , foresees the fall of Troy and abandons the city in favour of the Greeks ; his daughter , Criseyde , receives some ill will on account of her father s betrayal . Troilus , a warrior of Troy , publicly mocks love and is punished by the God of Love by being struck with irreconcilable desire for Criseyde , whom he sees passing through the temple . With the help of sly Pandarus , Criseyde s uncle , Troilus and Criseyde begin to exchange letters . Eventually , Pandarus develops a plan to urge the two into bed together ; Troilus swoons when he thinks the plan is going amiss , but Pandarus and Criseyde revive him . Pandarus leaves , and Troilus and Criseyde spend a night of bliss together . Calchas eventually persuades the Greeks to exchange a prisoner of war , Antenor , for his daughter Criseyde . Hector , of Troy , objects ; as does Troilus , although he does not voice his concern . Troilus speaks to Criseyde and suggests they elope but she offers a logical argument as to why it would not be practical . Criseyde promises to deceive her father and return to Troy after ten days ; Troilus leaves her with a sense of foreboding . Upon arriving in the Greek camp , Criseyde realizes the unlikeliness of her being able to keep her promise to Troilus . She writes dismissively in response to his letters and on the tenth day accepts a meeting with Diomede , and listens to him speak of love . Later , she accepts him as a lover . Pandarus and Troilus wait for Criseyde : Pandarus sees that she will not return and eventually Troilus realizes this as well . Troilus curses Fortune , even more so because he still loves Criseyde ; Pandarus offers some condolences . The narrator , with an apology for giving women a bad name , bids farewell to his book , and briefly recounts Troilus s death in battle and his ascent to the eighth sphere , draws a moral about the transience of earthly joys and the inadequacy of paganism , dedicates his poem to Gower and Strode , asks the protection of the Trinity , and prays that we be worthy of Christ s mercy .

The subject of Cratylus is the correctness of names (    ) , in other words , it is a critique on the subject of naming ( Baxter ) . When discussing a  ( onoma ) and how it would relate to its subject , Socrates compares the original creation of a word to the work of an artist . An artist uses color to express the essence of his subject in a painting . In much the same way , the creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word s subject . There is a letter that is best for soft things , one for liquid things , and so on . He comments ; the best possible way to speak consists in using names all ( or most ) of which are like the things they name ( that is , are appropriate to them ) , while the worst is to use the opposite kind of names . One countering position , held by Hermogenes , is that names have come about due to custom and convention . They do not express the essence of their subject , so they can be swapped with something unrelated by the individuals or communities who use them . The line between the two perspectives is often blurred . During more than half of the dialogue , Socrates makes guesses at Hermogenes ' request as to where names and words have come from . These include the names of the Olympian gods , personified deities , and many words that describe abstract concepts . He examines whether , for example , giving names of streams to Cronus and Rhea (   flow or space ) are purely accidental . Do n't you think he who gave to the ancestors of the other gods the names Rhea and Cronus had the same thought as Heracleitus ? Do you think he gave both of them the names of streams (   ) merely by chance ? The Greek term  may refer to the flow of any medium and is not restricted to the flow of water or liquids . Many of the words which Socrates uses as examples may have come from an idea originally linked to the name , but have changed over time . Those of which he can not find a link , he often assumes have come from foreign origins or have changed so much as to lose all resemblance to the original word . He states , names have been so twisted in all manner of ways , that I should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue . The final theory of relations between name and object named is posited by Cratylus , a disciple of Heraclitus , who believes that names arrive from divine origins , making them necessarily correct . Socrates rebukes this theory by reminding Cratylus of the imperfection of certain names in capturing the objects they seek to signify . From this point , Socrates ultimately rejects the study of language , believing it to be philosophically inferior to a study of things themselves .

They do not express the essence of their subject , so they can be swapped with something unrelated by the individuals or communities who use them . The line between the two perspectives is often blurred . During more than half of the dialogue , Socrates makes guesses at Hermogenes ' request as to where names and words have come from . These include the names of the Olympian gods , personified deities , and many words that describe abstract concepts . He examines whether , for example , giving names of streams to Cronus and Rhea (   flow or space ) are purely accidental . Do n't you think he who gave to the ancestors of the other gods the names Rhea and Cronus had the same thought as Heracleitus ? Do you think he gave both of them the names of streams (   ) merely by chance ? The Greek term  may refer to the flow of any medium and is not restricted to the flow of water or liquids . Many of the words which Socrates uses as examples may have come from an idea originally linked to the name , but have changed over time . Those of which he can not find a link , he often assumes have come from foreign origins or have changed so much as to lose all resemblance to the original word . He states , names have been so twisted in all manner of ways , that I should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue . The final theory of relations between name and object named is posited by Cratylus , a disciple of Heraclitus , who believes that names arrive from divine origins , making them necessarily correct . Socrates rebukes this theory by reminding Cratylus of the imperfection of certain names in capturing the objects they seek to signify . From this point , Socrates ultimately rejects the study of language , believing it to be philosophically inferior to a study of things themselves .


The subject of Cratylus is the correctness of names (    ) , in other words , it is a critique on the subject of naming ( Baxter ) . When discussing a  ( onoma ) and how it would relate to its subject , Socrates compares the original creation of a word to the work of an artist . An artist uses color to express the essence of his subject in a painting . In much the same way , the creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word s subject . There is a letter that is best for soft things , one for liquid things , and so on .

The plot revolves around Hypatia the pagan philosopher ; Cyril the Christian patriarch ; Orestes the power-hungry prefect of Egypt ; and Philammon an Egyptian monk . Philammon travels from his monastic community in the desert to Alexandria , and expresses a desire to attend Hypatia s lectures despite Cyril s dislike of Hypatia . Although Hypatia has a deep-seated hatred of Christianity , Philammon becomes her devoted friend and disciple . Philammon also encounters Pelagia , his long-lost sister , a former singer and dancer who is now married to a Gothic warrior . Philammon naturally desires to convert both women to Christianity . The plot is played out against the backdrop of Orestes ' scheming to become emperor of Egypt and Africa ; he uses Hypatia as a pawn . A subplot involves Raphael Aben-Ezra , a wealthy Jewish associate of Hypatia who falls in love with a Christian girl called Victoria and converts to win her love . A series of events , some of which are orchestrated by a Jewish woman called Miriam , raise tensions between the prefect and the church . Hypatia undergoes a spiritual crisis and comes close to being converted to Christianity by Raphael . Before this can happen , however , rumours are spread that Hypatia is the cause of unrest in the city and she is murdered by a Christian mob . Philammon , despondent , returns to the desert where he eventually becomes abbot of his monastery , albeit with a more worldly view of Christianity .

Hypatia undergoes a spiritual crisis and comes close to being converted to Christianity by Raphael . Before this can happen , however , rumours are spread that Hypatia is the cause of unrest in the city and she is murdered by a Christian mob . Philammon , despondent , returns to the desert where he eventually becomes abbot of his monastery , albeit with a more worldly view of Christianity .


The plot revolves around Hypatia the pagan philosopher ; Cyril the Christian patriarch ; Orestes the power-hungry prefect of Egypt ; and Philammon an Egyptian monk . Philammon travels from his monastic community in the desert to Alexandria , and expresses a desire to attend Hypatia s lectures despite Cyril s dislike of Hypatia . Although Hypatia has a deep-seated hatred of Christianity , Philammon becomes her devoted friend and disciple . Philammon also encounters Pelagia , his long-lost sister , a former singer and dancer who is now married to a Gothic warrior . Philammon naturally desires to convert both women to Christianity . The plot is played out against the backdrop of Orestes ' scheming to become emperor of Egypt and Africa ; he uses Hypatia as a pawn .

In 1815 , French prisoner Jean Valjean is released on parole from Toulon prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread and trying to escape multiple times . On the outside , Valjeans paroled status prevents him from getting work . He is offered shelter by the kindly Bishop of Digne , but Valjean steals his silverware . Captured by police and taken to the Bishop , Valjean is shocked when the Bishop says he gave him the silver , telling him to use it to do something worthwhile with his life . Valjean breaks his parole to start a new life . Eight years later , Valjean is factory owner and mayor of Montreuil , Pas-de-Calais . He is shocked when a Toulon prison guard Javert arrives as his new chief of police . Javert suspects Valjeans identity when he rescues an injured worker trapped under a heavy cart . One of Valjeans workers , Fantine , is dismissed by the factory foreman upon learning she is sending her earnings to her illegitimate daughter Cosette , who lives with the greedy innkeepers , the Thnardiers . To support her daughter , Fantine becomes a prostitute but is arrested by Javert when she attacks an abusive customer . Valjean , learning who she is , has her hospitalised . Valjean learns a man has been wrongly identified as him , and reveals his true identity to a court before returning to the dying Fantine , promising to care for Cosette . Javert arrives but Valjean escapes , finding Cosette and pays Fantines debts to the Thnardiers . Valjean and Cosette flee Javert , hiding in a convent , aided by the worker Valjean rescued before . Nine years later , Valjean has become a philanthropist and helps the poor in Paris . General Lamarque , the only government official sympathetic to the poor , dies , and a group of revolutionists called the Friends of the ABC plot to rebel against the monarchy .

At a thanksgiving service in Woodstock church for the victory at Worcester ( 3 September 1651 ) , the Rev . Nehemiah Holdenough was compelled to cede the pulpit , which he had usurped from the late rector ( Dr Rochecliffe ) , to Joseph Tomkins , who , in military attire , declaimed against monarchy and prelacy , and announced the sequestration of the royal lodge and park by Cromwell and his followers . Proceeding thither , he encountered Sir Henry Lee , accompanied by his daughter Alice , prepared to surrender his charge , and was conducted through the principal apartments by the forester Joliffe , who managed to send his sweetheart Phoebe and dog Bevis with some provisions to his hut , in which the knight and his daughter had arranged to sleep . On arriving there they found Colonel Everard , a Roundhead who had come to offer them his own and his father s protection ; but Sir Henry abused and spurned his nephew as a rebel , and at Alice s entreaty he bade them farewell , as he feared , for ever . On his way to the lodge he met his Royalist friend , Captain Wildrake , whom he was sheltering in spite of his politics , and determined to send him with an appeal to Cromwell to reinstate his uncle at Woodstock . On reaching Windsor , the captain , disguised as a Roundhead , obtained an interview with Oliver Cromwell , and a compliance with Everard s request , on condition that he would aid in securing the murdered king s son , in the event of his seeking refuge with the Lees . Armed with the warrant of ejectment , the colonel and Wildrake , accompanied by the mayor and the minister , visited the Commissioners during their evening carouse , and took part in endeavouring to ascertain the cause of some startling occurrences by which they had been disturbed . Everard made his way alone to a dark gallery , in which he fancied he heard his cousin s voice , and suddenly felt a sword at his throat . Meeting Wildrake as he regained the hall , they hurried off to the hut where they found Dr Rochecliffe reading the Church service to Sir Henry and his daughter ; and , after a reconciliation between uncle and nephew , the cousins were allowed a private interview , during which Alice warned her lover against betraying the king . Returning to the lodge they were told of other unaccountable events ; and during the night Everard was ordered by an apparition to change his quarters . The sentinels also declared that they had heard strange sounds , and the Commissioners decided to retire to the village inn . Master Holdenough , too , confessed that he had been terribly shocked by the reflection in a mirror of the figure of a college friend whom he had seen drowned . The following day Sir Henry Lee was induced to resume his post , and his son Albert arrived with one Louis Kerneguy , whom he introduced as his Scotch page . Sir Henry having no suspicion who his guest really was treated him without ceremony ; and while Dr Rochecliffe and the colonel were planning for his escape to Holland , the disguised Charles amused himself by endeavouring to gain Alice s love ; but , in spite of a declaration of his rank , she made him ashamed of his suit . A quarrel , however , having arisen between him and Everard , she evinced her loyalty by preventing a duel they had arranged , at the risk of her reputation and the loss of her cousin s affection . A similar attempt by Tomkins to trifle with Phoebe was punished by a death-blow from Joliffe . The next evening Everard and his friend , and Holdenough , were unexpectedly made prisoners by Cromwell , who , having received intelligence of their knowledge of the king s sojourn at Woodstock , had brought a large force to secure him . Wildrake , however , managed to send his page Spitfire to the lodge to warn them , and while Alice acted as Charles s guide , Albert , in his dress , concealed himself in Rosamond s tower . Cromwell and his soldiers arrived soon afterwards with Dr Rochecliffe and Joliffe , whom they had seized as they were burying Tomkins , and , having searched all the rooms and passages in vain , they proceeded to blow up the tower . Albert , however , leapt from it just before the explosion , and Cromwell was furious when he discovered the deception . In his rage he ordered the execution of the old knight and all his abettors , including his dog ; but afterwards released them , with the exception of Albert , who was imprisoned , and subsequently fell in the battle of Dunkirk ( 1658 ) . Alice returned in safety , with the news that the king had effected his escape , and a letter from him to Sir Henry , approving of her marriage with Everard , whose political opinions had been considerably influenced by recent events . Eight years later Wildrake arrived at Brussels with news for Charles . After Cromwell s son Richard abdicated , the Protectorate was abolished and the country descended into chaos . Order was restored when George Monck , the Governor of Scotland , marched into the City of London with his army and forced the Rump Parliament to re-admit members of the Long Parliament excluded during Pride s Purge . The Long Parliament dissolved itself and for the first time in almost 20 years , there was a general election . The Convention Parliament assembled and voted for Charles ' restoration . In his progress to London , Charles , escorted by a brilliant retinue , amidst shouts of welcome from his assembled subjects , dismounted to salute a family group in which the central figure was the old knight of Ditchley , whose venerable features expressed his appreciation of the happiness of once more pressing his sovereign s hand , and whose contented death almost immediately followed the realisation of his anxious and long-cherished hopes .

In his progress to London , Charles , escorted by a brilliant retinue , amidst shouts of welcome from his assembled subjects , dismounted to salute a family group in which the central figure was the old knight of Ditchley , whose venerable features expressed his appreciation of the happiness of once more pressing his sovereign s hand , and whose contented death almost immediately followed the realisation of his anxious and long-cherished hopes .


At a thanksgiving service in Woodstock church for the victory at Worcester ( 3 September 1651 ) , the Rev . Nehemiah Holdenough was compelled to cede the pulpit , which he had usurped from the late rector ( Dr Rochecliffe ) , to Joseph Tomkins , who , in military attire , declaimed against monarchy and prelacy , and announced the sequestration of the royal lodge and park by Cromwell and his followers . Proceeding thither , he encountered Sir Henry Lee , accompanied by his daughter Alice , prepared to surrender his charge , and was conducted through the principal apartments by the forester Joliffe , who managed to send his sweetheart Phoebe and dog Bevis with some provisions to his hut , in which the knight and his daughter had arranged to sleep . On arriving there they found Colonel Everard , a Roundhead who had come to offer them his own and his father s protection ; but Sir Henry abused and spurned his nephew as a rebel , and at Alice s entreaty he bade them farewell , as he feared , for ever . On his way to the lodge he met his Royalist friend , Captain Wildrake , whom he was sheltering in spite of his politics , and determined to send him with an appeal to Cromwell to reinstate his uncle at Woodstock . On reaching Windsor , the captain , disguised as a Roundhead , obtained an interview with Oliver Cromwell , and a compliance with Everard s request , on condition that he would aid in securing the murdered king s son , in the event of his seeking refuge with the Lees . Armed with the warrant of ejectment , the colonel and Wildrake , accompanied by the mayor and the minister , visited the Commissioners during their evening carouse , and took part in endeavouring to ascertain the cause of some startling occurrences by which they had been disturbed . Everard made his way alone to a dark gallery , in which he fancied he heard his cousin s voice , and suddenly felt a sword at his throat . Meeting Wildrake as he regained the hall , they hurried off to the hut where they found Dr Rochecliffe reading the Church service to Sir Henry and his daughter ; and , after a reconciliation between uncle and nephew , the cousins were allowed a private interview , during which Alice warned her lover against betraying the king . Returning to the lodge they were told of other unaccountable events ; and during the night Everard was ordered by an apparition to change his quarters . The sentinels also declared that they had heard strange sounds , and the Commissioners decided to retire to the village inn . Master Holdenough , too , confessed that he had been terribly shocked by the reflection in a mirror of the figure of a college friend whom he had seen drowned . The following day Sir Henry Lee was induced to resume his post , and his son Albert arrived with one Louis Kerneguy , whom he introduced as his Scotch page . Sir Henry having no suspicion who his guest really was treated him without ceremony ; and while Dr Rochecliffe and the colonel were planning for his escape to Holland , the disguised Charles amused himself by endeavouring to gain Alice s love ; but , in spite of a declaration of his rank , she made him ashamed of his suit . A quarrel , however , having arisen between him and Everard , she evinced her loyalty by preventing a duel they had arranged , at the risk of her reputation and the loss of her cousin s affection . A similar attempt by Tomkins to trifle with Phoebe was punished by a death-blow from Joliffe . The next evening Everard and his friend , and Holdenough , were unexpectedly made prisoners by Cromwell , who , having received intelligence of their knowledge of the king s sojourn at Woodstock , had brought a large force to secure him . Wildrake , however , managed to send his page Spitfire to the lodge to warn them , and while Alice acted as Charles s guide , Albert , in his dress , concealed himself in Rosamond s tower . Cromwell and his soldiers arrived soon afterwards with Dr Rochecliffe and Joliffe , whom they had seized as they were burying Tomkins , and , having searched all the rooms and passages in vain , they proceeded to blow up the tower . Albert , however , leapt from it just before the explosion , and Cromwell was furious when he discovered the deception . In his rage he ordered the execution of the old knight and all his abettors , including his dog ; but afterwards released them , with the exception of Albert , who was imprisoned , and subsequently fell in the battle of Dunkirk ( 1658 ) .

The next evening Everard and his friend , and Holdenough , were unexpectedly made prisoners by Cromwell , who , having received intelligence of their knowledge of the king s sojourn at Woodstock , had brought a large force to secure him . Wildrake , however , managed to send his page Spitfire to the lodge to warn them , and while Alice acted as Charles s guide , Albert , in his dress , concealed himself in Rosamond s tower . Cromwell and his soldiers arrived soon afterwards with Dr Rochecliffe and Joliffe , whom they had seized as they were burying Tomkins , and , having searched all the rooms and passages in vain , they proceeded to blow up the tower . Albert , however , leapt from it just before the explosion , and Cromwell was furious when he discovered the deception . In his rage he ordered the execution of the old knight and all his abettors , including his dog ; but afterwards released them , with the exception of Albert , who was imprisoned , and subsequently fell in the battle of Dunkirk ( 1658 ) . Alice returned in safety , with the news that the king had effected his escape , and a letter from him to Sir Henry , approving of her marriage with Everard , whose political opinions had been considerably influenced by recent events . Eight years later Wildrake arrived at Brussels with news for Charles . After Cromwell s son Richard abdicated , the Protectorate was abolished and the country descended into chaos . Order was restored when George Monck , the Governor of Scotland , marched into the City of London with his army and forced the Rump Parliament to re-admit members of the Long Parliament excluded during Pride s Purge . The Long Parliament dissolved itself and for the first time in almost 20 years , there was a general election . The Convention Parliament assembled and voted for Charles ' restoration . In his progress to London , Charles , escorted by a brilliant retinue , amidst shouts of welcome from his assembled subjects , dismounted to salute a family group in which the central figure was the old knight of Ditchley , whose venerable features expressed his appreciation of the happiness of once more pressing his sovereign s hand , and whose contented death almost immediately followed the realisation of his anxious and long-cherished hopes .


At a thanksgiving service in Woodstock church for the victory at Worcester ( 3 September 1651 ) , the Rev . Nehemiah Holdenough was compelled to cede the pulpit , which he had usurped from the late rector ( Dr Rochecliffe ) , to Joseph Tomkins , who , in military attire , declaimed against monarchy and prelacy , and announced the sequestration of the royal lodge and park by Cromwell and his followers . Proceeding thither , he encountered Sir Henry Lee , accompanied by his daughter Alice , prepared to surrender his charge , and was conducted through the principal apartments by the forester Joliffe , who managed to send his sweetheart Phoebe and dog Bevis with some provisions to his hut , in which the knight and his daughter had arranged to sleep . On arriving there they found Colonel Everard , a Roundhead who had come to offer them his own and his father s protection ; but Sir Henry abused and spurned his nephew as a rebel , and at Alice s entreaty he bade them farewell , as he feared , for ever . On his way to the lodge he met his Royalist friend , Captain Wildrake , whom he was sheltering in spite of his politics , and determined to send him with an appeal to Cromwell to reinstate his uncle at Woodstock . On reaching Windsor , the captain , disguised as a Roundhead , obtained an interview with Oliver Cromwell , and a compliance with Everard s request , on condition that he would aid in securing the murdered king s son , in the event of his seeking refuge with the Lees . Armed with the warrant of ejectment , the colonel and Wildrake , accompanied by the mayor and the minister , visited the Commissioners during their evening carouse , and took part in endeavouring to ascertain the cause of some startling occurrences by which they had been disturbed . Everard made his way alone to a dark gallery , in which he fancied he heard his cousin s voice , and suddenly felt a sword at his throat . Meeting Wildrake as he regained the hall , they hurried off to the hut where they found Dr Rochecliffe reading the Church service to Sir Henry and his daughter ; and , after a reconciliation between uncle and nephew , the cousins were allowed a private interview , during which Alice warned her lover against betraying the king . Returning to the lodge they were told of other unaccountable events ; and during the night Everard was ordered by an apparition to change his quarters . The sentinels also declared that they had heard strange sounds , and the Commissioners decided to retire to the village inn . Master Holdenough , too , confessed that he had been terribly shocked by the reflection in a mirror of the figure of a college friend whom he had seen drowned . The following day Sir Henry Lee was induced to resume his post , and his son Albert arrived with one Louis Kerneguy , whom he introduced as his Scotch page . Sir Henry having no suspicion who his guest really was treated him without ceremony ; and while Dr Rochecliffe and the colonel were planning for his escape to Holland , the disguised Charles amused himself by endeavouring to gain Alice s love ; but , in spite of a declaration of his rank , she made him ashamed of his suit .

Five years after the Viking village of Berk and the dragons made peace , they now live together in harmony . Hiccup goes on adventures with his dragon , Toothless , as they discover and map unexplored lands . Now 20 years old , he is being pressed by his father , Stoick the Vast , to succeed him as chieftain , although Hiccup remains unsure if he is ready for this responsibility . While investigating a burnt forest , Hiccup and Astrid discover the remains of a fort encased in ice and meet a group of dragon trappers led by Eret , who blames them for his fort s destruction and attempts to capture their dragons for an insane conqueror named Drago Bludvist . The two dragon riders escape and return to Berk to warn Stoick about the dragon army that Drago is amassing . Stoick orders the villagers to fortify the island and prepare for battle . Hiccup , however , refuses to believe that war is inevitable . After Stoick interrupts Hiccup s plan to get Eret to take him to Drago , Stoick explains that he once met Drago at a gathering of chiefs , where Drago , mocked after offering the chiefs his service in return for their servitude , murdered them all using armored dragons , with Stoick as the only survivor . Undeterred , Hiccup flies off with Toothless in search of Drago to try to reason with him . They run into a dragon rider named Valka , who is revealed to be Hiccup s long-lost mother . She explains that she , like her son , could not bring herself to kill dragons . After being carried off during a dragon raid , she spent twenty years rescuing dragons from Drago s traps and bringing them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic Alpha dragon called a Bewilderbeast , which is able to control smaller dragons . Stoick tracks Hiccup to the nest , where he discovers that his wife is still alive . Meanwhile , Astrid and the other riders kidnap Eret to find Drago , but Drago captures them and learns of Berk s dragons . Drago and his armada lay siege to the nest , where he reveals that he has his own Bewilderbeast to challenge the Alpha . A battle ensues between the two colossal dragons , which ends with Drago s Bewilderbeast killing its opponent and becoming the new Alpha . Drago s Bewilderbeast then seizes control of all the adult dragons , who hypnotically obey . Hiccup tries to persuade Drago to end the violence , but Drago orders him killed . Toothless , under the Bewilderbeast s influence , approaches Hiccup and launches a blast , but Stoick pushes Hiccup out of the way and is hit instead , killing him . The Bewilderbeast momentarily relinquishes control of Toothless , but Hiccup drives him away in a fit of despair . Drago maroons Hiccup and the others on the island and rides Toothless , again under the control of the Bewilderbeast , to lead his army to conquer Berk . Stoick is given a Viking funeral and Hiccup , now having lost both his father and dragon , is unsure what to do . Valka encourages him by telling him that he alone can unite humans and dragons , and inspired by her words and his father s , Hiccup decides to return to Berk to stop Drago . The dragon riders fly baby dragons back to Berk , as they are immune to the Bewilderbeast s control . They find that Drago has already attacked the village and taken control of its dragons . Hiccup confronts Drago and a brainwashed Toothless while the other riders work to distract the Bewilderbeast . Hiccup succeeds in freeing Toothless from the Bewilderbeast s control , much to Drago s surprise . Hiccup and Toothless briefly separate Drago from the Bewilderbeast and confront Drago on the ground , but the Bewilderbeast attacks them , encasing them in ice . However , Toothless blasts away the ice , revealing that both he and Hiccup are unharmed . He then challenges the Bewilderbeast , shooting it in the face repeatedly , which breaks its control over the other dragons , who now side with Toothless as the new Alpha dragon . All the dragons repeatedly fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a final massive blast , breaking its left tusk . Defeated , the Bewilderbeast retreats under the sea with Drago on its back . The Vikings and dragons celebrate their victory and Hiccup is made chieftain of Berk . Afterwards , Berk undergoes repairs while feeling secure knowing that its dragons can defend it .

Hiccup goes on adventures with his dragon , Toothless , as they discover and map unexplored lands . Now 20 years old , he is being pressed by his father , Stoick the Vast , to succeed him as chieftain , although Hiccup remains unsure if he is ready for this responsibility . While investigating a burnt forest , Hiccup and Astrid discover the remains of a fort encased in ice and meet a group of dragon trappers led by Eret , who blames them for his fort s destruction and attempts to capture their dragons for an insane conqueror named Drago Bludvist . The two dragon riders escape and return to Berk to warn Stoick about the dragon army that Drago is amassing . Stoick orders the villagers to fortify the island and prepare for battle . Hiccup , however , refuses to believe that war is inevitable . After Stoick interrupts Hiccup s plan to get Eret to take him to Drago , Stoick explains that he once met Drago at a gathering of chiefs , where Drago , mocked after offering the chiefs his service in return for their servitude , murdered them all using armored dragons , with Stoick as the only survivor . Undeterred , Hiccup flies off with Toothless in search of Drago to try to reason with him . They run into a dragon rider named Valka , who is revealed to be Hiccup s long-lost mother . She explains that she , like her son , could not bring herself to kill dragons . After being carried off during a dragon raid , she spent twenty years rescuing dragons from Drago s traps and bringing them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic Alpha dragon called a Bewilderbeast , which is able to control smaller dragons . Stoick tracks Hiccup to the nest , where he discovers that his wife is still alive . Meanwhile , Astrid and the other riders kidnap Eret to find Drago , but Drago captures them and learns of Berk s dragons . Drago and his armada lay siege to the nest , where he reveals that he has his own Bewilderbeast to challenge the Alpha . A battle ensues between the two colossal dragons , which ends with Drago s Bewilderbeast killing its opponent and becoming the new Alpha . Drago s Bewilderbeast then seizes control of all the adult dragons , who hypnotically obey . Hiccup tries to persuade Drago to end the violence , but Drago orders him killed . Toothless , under the Bewilderbeast s influence , approaches Hiccup and launches a blast , but Stoick pushes Hiccup out of the way and is hit instead , killing him . The Bewilderbeast momentarily relinquishes control of Toothless , but Hiccup drives him away in a fit of despair . Drago maroons Hiccup and the others on the island and rides Toothless , again under the control of the Bewilderbeast , to lead his army to conquer Berk . Stoick is given a Viking funeral and Hiccup , now having lost both his father and dragon , is unsure what to do . Valka encourages him by telling him that he alone can unite humans and dragons , and inspired by her words and his father s , Hiccup decides to return to Berk to stop Drago . The dragon riders fly baby dragons back to Berk , as they are immune to the Bewilderbeast s control . They find that Drago has already attacked the village and taken control of its dragons . Hiccup confronts Drago and a brainwashed Toothless while the other riders work to distract the Bewilderbeast . Hiccup succeeds in freeing Toothless from the Bewilderbeast s control , much to Drago s surprise . Hiccup and Toothless briefly separate Drago from the Bewilderbeast and confront Drago on the ground , but the Bewilderbeast attacks them , encasing them in ice . However , Toothless blasts away the ice , revealing that both he and Hiccup are unharmed . He then challenges the Bewilderbeast , shooting it in the face repeatedly , which breaks its control over the other dragons , who now side with Toothless as the new Alpha dragon . All the dragons repeatedly fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a final massive blast , breaking its left tusk . Defeated , the Bewilderbeast retreats under the sea with Drago on its back . The Vikings and dragons celebrate their victory and Hiccup is made chieftain of Berk . Afterwards , Berk undergoes repairs while feeling secure knowing that its dragons can defend it .

After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup , England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie ( Colm Meaney ) , the highly successful manager of Leeds United . Revie s replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough ( Michael Sheen ) , the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds , because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie s management . Furthermore , Clough s longtime assistant , Peter Taylor ( Timothy Spall ) , has not joined him . The roots of Clough s conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds , the leaders of the First Division and Derby , who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division . Clough , assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself , as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland , made many preparations for the match ; come the day of the match however , Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground . Derby eventually lost 20 . Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players , he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level . So they sign veteran Dave Mackay ( Brian McCardie ) , along with several other young players . Chairman Sam Longson ( Jim Broadbent ) is extremely anxious about the investment , as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay . However , in 1969 Derby are promoted . They once again face Leeds , only to lose 50 . The club win their first ever League championship in 1972 , meaning a European Cup campaign the following year . They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus . Unfortunately , against Longson s advice , Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final , against Leeds , purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie . They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner ( Stephen Graham ) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final . Juventus defeat them 3-1 , and Clough publicly lambasts Longson . Taylor then suffers a heart attack , and Clough tries to secure his position by offering his and Taylor s resignations in a protest against the chairman s unwilligness to fund further signings . To his horror , the club accepts their resignations and bans them from entering the Baseball Ground again ( although Clough later sneaks in as a supporter ) . Derby fans ' outrage raises Clough s hopes of being reinstated , and he is backed by the majority of his players as well , but former player Dave Mackay is appointed manager instead . Derby fans quickly lose interest and Clough loses all hope of getting his job back . He and Taylor are then offered jobs at Brighton & Hove Albion . They agree to take the jobs after taking an all-expenses-paid holiday in Majorca . During the holiday that summer , Clough agrees to take control of Leeds after being approached by their representatives . Taylor , however , argues the case for staying at Brighton , and after a bitter quarrel , the two go their separate ways . Back in the storyline s present . Clough alienates his players in their first training session , first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they never won any of them fairly , and then making them start with a 7-a-side game , which Bremner points out Don Revie never made them do . Clough reminds them that he is not Mr Revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager s name or methods again . The season starts with a Charity Shield match against FA Cup winners Liverpool at Wembley , which is widely anticipated as both the final match of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and Clough s debut as Leeds manager . Unfortunately , the event is marred when Leeds s captain , Billy Bremner gets into a fight with Kevin Keegan . Both are sent off , and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance . Leeds lose the match on penalties , and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football , forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain . As a result , Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title . After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board , the club terminates Clough s contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package . Afterwards , Clough agrees to do a final interview with Yorkshire Television , but finds Revie there to confront him , bringing the two face to face at last . Clough accuses Revie of being cold-hearted ' and fundamentally dishonest ' , both as a person and a football manager , and Revie in turn brands Clough as inflexible and egocentric ' . Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup , and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time ( a doubtful claim considering that Revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced ) . After the interview , Clough drives down to Brighton to patch things up with Taylor . It involves Clough literally on his knees , grovelling at Taylor s dictation , and they are reconciled . In the film s epilogue , the audience is told that Don Revie failed as England manager , and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again , spending the rest of his career working in the Middle East , where he was accused of financial mismanagement . Brian Clough and Peter Taylor , meanwhile , reunited at the small , provincial club ' Nottingham Forest , where they repeated their prior achievements with Derby by taking them up and winning the First Division . They then bettered both Revie and their own spell at Derby by winning two European Cups in succession , in 1979 and 1980 . The film ends by branding Clough the best manager that the English national side never had .

They then bettered both Revie and their own spell at Derby by winning two European Cups in succession , in 1979 and 1980 . The film ends by branding Clough the best manager that the English national side never had .


After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup , England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie ( Colm Meaney ) , the highly successful manager of Leeds United . Revie s replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough ( Michael Sheen ) , the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds , because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie s management . Furthermore , Clough s longtime assistant , Peter Taylor ( Timothy Spall ) , has not joined him . The roots of Clough s conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds , the leaders of the First Division and Derby , who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division . Clough , assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself , as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland , made many preparations for the match ; come the day of the match however , Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground . Derby eventually lost 20 . Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players , he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level . So they sign veteran Dave Mackay ( Brian McCardie ) , along with several other young players . Chairman Sam Longson ( Jim Broadbent ) is extremely anxious about the investment , as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay . However , in 1969 Derby are promoted . They once again face Leeds , only to lose 50 . The club win their first ever League championship in 1972 , meaning a European Cup campaign the following year . They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus . Unfortunately , against Longson s advice , Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final , against Leeds , purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie . They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner ( Stephen Graham ) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final . Juventus defeat them 3-1 , and Clough publicly lambasts Longson . Taylor then suffers a heart attack , and Clough tries to secure his position by offering his and Taylor s resignations in a protest against the chairman s unwilligness to fund further signings . To his horror , the club accepts their resignations and bans them from entering the Baseball Ground again ( although Clough later sneaks in as a supporter ) . Derby fans ' outrage raises Clough s hopes of being reinstated , and he is backed by the majority of his players as well , but former player Dave Mackay is appointed manager instead . Derby fans quickly lose interest and Clough loses all hope of getting his job back . He and Taylor are then offered jobs at Brighton & Hove Albion . They agree to take the jobs after taking an all-expenses-paid holiday in Majorca . During the holiday that summer , Clough agrees to take control of Leeds after being approached by their representatives . Taylor , however , argues the case for staying at Brighton , and after a bitter quarrel , the two go their separate ways . Back in the storyline s present . Clough alienates his players in their first training session , first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they never won any of them fairly , and then making them start with a 7-a-side game , which Bremner points out Don Revie never made them do . Clough reminds them that he is not Mr Revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager s name or methods again . The season starts with a Charity Shield match against FA Cup winners Liverpool at Wembley , which is widely anticipated as both the final match of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and Clough s debut as Leeds manager . Unfortunately , the event is marred when Leeds s captain , Billy Bremner gets into a fight with Kevin Keegan . Both are sent off , and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance . Leeds lose the match on penalties , and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football , forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain . As a result , Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title . After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board , the club terminates Clough s contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package . Afterwards , Clough agrees to do a final interview with Yorkshire Television , but finds Revie there to confront him , bringing the two face to face at last . Clough accuses Revie of being cold-hearted ' and fundamentally dishonest ' , both as a person and a football manager , and Revie in turn brands Clough as inflexible and egocentric ' . Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup , and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time ( a doubtful claim considering that Revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced ) . After the interview , Clough drives down to Brighton to patch things up with Taylor . It involves Clough literally on his knees , grovelling at Taylor s dictation , and they are reconciled .

In 1957 , nineteen years after The Last Crusade , Indiana Jones and his partner George Mac McHale are kidnapped in Nevada by Soviet agents under Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko . The Soviets infiltrate a warehouse labeled Warehouse 51 and force Jones to locate an alien corpse with a crystal skull , recovered ten years earlier . Upon its discovery , Mac reveals he is a double agent working for the Soviets . Jones escapes and unsuccessfully attempts to retrieve the skull . After a fight with Spalko s sadistic henchman , Colonel Antonin Dovchenko , Jones escapes to a model town at the Nevada Test Site , minutes before an atomic bomb test , and takes shelter in a lead-lined refrigerator . Jones is rescued , decontaminated , and apprehended by FBI agents , who suspect him of working for the Soviets ; and though freed on the recommendation of General Ross , who vouches for him , he is put on indefinite leave of absence from Marshall College , also at the cost of the dean having to resign to keep Indiana s job at the college . Jones is approached by greaser Mutt Williams , who tells him that Harold Oxley had found a crystal skull in Peru , suffered a mental breakdown , and was later kidnapped . In return , Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator . Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother , who is also held captive , containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient Native American language . KGB agents try to take the letter , but Jones and Mutt evade them and reach Peru . At the local psychiatric hospital , Oxley s scribbles on the walls and floor of his cell lead them to the grave of Francisco de Orellana , a Conquistador searching for Akator . They discover the skull at the grave , with Jones reasoning that Oxley had returned it there . Jones and Mutt are captured by Mac and the Soviets and taken to their camp in the Amazon jungle , where they find Oxley and Mutt s mother , Marion Ravenwood , who later reveals that Mutt is Jones ' son , Henry Jones III . Jones berates her for not convincing him to finish school . Mac tells Jones he is really a CIA double-agent to regain Jones ' trust . Spalko believes that the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great psychic power , and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare . Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator . Jones and his four allies escape with the skull into the Amazon . They elude giant ants , which devour Dovchenko after Jones beats him in a fight . Jones and his allies survive three waterfalls in a GAZ 46 amphibious vehicle , as many of the Soviets fall from a cliff while trying to pursue them . Jones and Oxley then identify a rock formation that leads them to Akator , unaware that Mac is still loyal to Spalko and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them . They escape the city s guardians , gain access to the temple , and find it filled with artifacts from many ancient civilizations . Indy believes the aliens - in fact , inter-dimensional beings - were archaeologists studying the different cultures of Earth , and Mac remarks that every museum in the world would want the temple s collection . The five enter a chamber containing the crystal skeletons of thirteen enthroned skeletal crystal beings , one missing its skull . Spalko arrives and presents the skull to this skeleton . It suddenly flies from her hands to the skeleton and rejoins , whereupon the aliens reanimate and telepathically offer a reward in ancient Mayan through Oxley . A portal to their dimension becomes activated , and Spalko demands knowledge equal to the aliens ' . The thirteen beings fuse into one , and in the process of receiving the overwhelming knowledge , Spalko is disintegrated and sucked into the portal . Indy , Marion , Mutt , and Oxley - now released from the skull - escape , while the Soviets are also drawn into the portal . Mac is caught in the pull while trying to scrounge some of the treasure , and even though Indy offers him his whip to pull him to safety , he replies with a wink of his eye , Jonesy , I m gon na be all right , lets go and is pulled in . The survivors watch as the temple walls crumble , revealing a flying saucer rising from the debris , which vanishes into the space between spaces while the hollow in the valley floor left by its departure is flooded by the waters of the Amazon . The following year , Indy is reinstated at Marshall College and made an associate dean . He and Marion are then married in a church . As the wedding party leaves the chapel , a gust of wind blows Indy s brown fedora off the coat rack and deposits it at Mutt s feet . Mutt picks it up and is about to don it before Indy snatches it from his hands and puts it on with a grin .

In 1957 , nineteen years after The Last Crusade , Indiana Jones and his partner George Mac McHale are kidnapped in Nevada by Soviet agents under Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko . The Soviets infiltrate a warehouse labeled Warehouse 51 and force Jones to locate an alien corpse with a crystal skull , recovered ten years earlier . Upon its discovery , Mac reveals he is a double agent working for the Soviets . Jones escapes and unsuccessfully attempts to retrieve the skull . After a fight with Spalko s sadistic henchman , Colonel Antonin Dovchenko , Jones escapes to a model town at the Nevada Test Site , minutes before an atomic bomb test , and takes shelter in a lead-lined refrigerator . Jones is rescued , decontaminated , and apprehended by FBI agents , who suspect him of working for the Soviets ; and though freed on the recommendation of General Ross , who vouches for him , he is put on indefinite leave of absence from Marshall College , also at the cost of the dean having to resign to keep Indiana s job at the college . Jones is approached by greaser Mutt Williams , who tells him that Harold Oxley had found a crystal skull in Peru , suffered a mental breakdown , and was later kidnapped . In return , Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator . Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother , who is also held captive , containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient Native American language . KGB agents try to take the letter , but Jones and Mutt evade them and reach Peru . At the local psychiatric hospital , Oxley s scribbles on the walls and floor of his cell lead them to the grave of Francisco de Orellana , a Conquistador searching for Akator .

Jones and Mutt are captured by Mac and the Soviets and taken to their camp in the Amazon jungle , where they find Oxley and Mutt s mother , Marion Ravenwood , who later reveals that Mutt is Jones ' son , Henry Jones III . Jones berates her for not convincing him to finish school . Mac tells Jones he is really a CIA double-agent to regain Jones ' trust . Spalko believes that the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great psychic power , and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare . Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator . Jones and his four allies escape with the skull into the Amazon .

The House of the Wolfings is a romantically reconstructed portrait of the lives of the Germanic Gothic tribes , written in an archaic style and incorporating a large amount of poetry . Morris combines his own idealistic views with what was actually known at the time of his subjects ' folkways and language . He portrays them as simple and hardworking , galvanized into heroic action to defend their families and liberty by the attacks of imperial Rome . Morris s Goths inhabit an area called the Mark on a river in the forest of Mirkwood , divided into the Upper-mark , the Mid-mark and the Nether-mark . They worship their gods Odin and Tyr by sacrificing horses , and rely on seers who foretell the future and serve as psychic news-gatherers . The men of the Mark choose two War Dukes to lead them against their enemies , one each from the House of the Wolfings and the House of the Laxings .

Mary s expectations are low , as she tells her hamster . Mary is pleasantly surprised when her date turns out to be handsome and charming Steve Miller , a cameraman for the television news network CCN . Steve does not reciprocate her feelings . After an attempt at an intimate moment fails , in part because of her awkwardness and inability to stop talking about vocabulary , Steve fakes a phone call about covering the news out of town . Trying to get Mary out of his truck , he tells her he wishes she could be there . Mary believes him and decides to pursue him . Mary s obsession gets her fired when she creates a crossword titled All About Steve . Following her termination , Mary decides to track Steve around the country in the hopes of winning his affection .

The novel is divided into three volumes . Part One ( Chapters 1 to 15 ) : Gilbert Markham narrates how a mysterious widow , Mrs Helen Graham , arrives at Wildfell Hall , a nearby mansion . A source of curiosity for the small community , the reticent Mrs Graham and her young son Arthur are slowly drawn into the social circles of the village . Initially Gilbert Markham casually courts Eliza Millward , despite his mother s belief that he can do better . His interest in Eliza wanes as he comes to know Mrs Graham . In retribution Eliza spreads ( and perhaps creates ) scandalous rumours about Helen . With gossip flying , Gilbert is led to believe that his friend Mr Lawrence is courting Mrs Graham . At a chance meeting on a road Gilbert strikes the mounted Lawrence with a whip handle , causing him to fall from his horse . Though she is unaware of this confrontation , Helen Graham still refuses to marry Gilbert , but when he accuses her of loving Lawrence she gives him her diaries . Part two ( Chapters 16 to 44 ) is taken from Helen s diaries , in which she describes her marriage to Arthur Huntingdon . The handsome , witty Huntingdon is also spoilt , selfish and self-indulgent . Before marrying Helen he flirts with Annabella , and uses this to manipulate Helen and convince her to marry him . Helen , blinded by love , marries him , and resolves to reform him with gentle persuasion and good example . After the birth of their only child , however , Huntingdon becomes increasingly jealous of their son ( also called Arthur ) , and his claims on Helen s attentions and affections . Huntingdon s pack of dissolute friends frequently engage in drunken revels at the family s home , Grassdale , oppressing those of finer character . Both men and women are portrayed as degraded . In particular , Annabella , now Lady Lowborough , is shown to be unfaithful to her melancholy but devoted husband . Walter Hargrave , the brother of Helen s friend Milicent Hargrave , vies for Helen s affections . While he is not as wild as his peers , he is an unwelcome admirer : Helen senses his predatory nature when they play chess . Walter tells Helen of Arthur s affair with Lady Lowborough . When his friends depart Arthur pines openly for his paramour and derides his wife . Arthur s corruption of their son  encouraging him to drink and swear at his tender age  is the last straw for Helen . She plans to flee to save her son , but her husband learns of her plans from her diary and burns the artist s tools with which she had hoped to support herself . Eventually , with help from her brother , Mr Lawrence , Helen finds a secret refuge at Wildfell Hall . Part Three ( Chapters 45 to 53 ) begins after Gilbert s reading of the diaries . Helen bids Gilbert to leave her because she is not free to marry . He complies and soon learns that she has returned to Grassdale because her husband is gravely ill. Helen s ministrations are in vain , and Huntingdon s death is painful since he is fraught with terror at what awaits him . Helen can not comfort him , for he rejects responsibility for his actions and wishes instead for her to come with him to plead for his salvation . A year passes . Gilbert pursues a rumour of Helen s impending wedding , only to find that Mr Lawrence , with whom he has reconciled , is marrying Helen s friend Esther Hargrave . Gilbert goes to Grassdale , and discovers that Helen is now wealthy and lives at her estate in Staningley . He travels there , but is plagued by anxiety that she is now far above his station . He encounters Helen , her aunt and young Arthur by chance . The two lovers reconcile and marry .

At the McDunnough residence the next day , Glen approaches Hi to fire him , and reveals that he has deduced Junior s identity because of the newspaper article he read about Junior missing , and blackmails Hi , threatening to turn him over to the police unless Glen and Dot get custody of Junior .

Nathan Sr. declines the offer , believing that Smalls himself is his son s kidnapper . Smalls decides to recover the child anyway to sell on the black market .

Architect Peter Mitchell ( Tom Selleck ) , cartoonist Michael Kellam ( Steve Guttenberg ) , and actor Jack Holden ( Ted Danson ) are happy living their lives as bachelors in their lofty New York City apartment where they have frequent parties and flings with different women . Their lives are disrupted when a baby named Mary arrives on their doorstep one day . A note with her , written by a lady named Sylvia , indicates that she is Jack s , the result of a tryst between the actor and actress . Mary arrives in his absence  he is in Turkey shooting a B movie , leaving Peter and Michael to fend for themselves in taking care of her . Prior to leaving , Jack had made arrangements with a director friend to have a package delivered to the apartment as a favor . Before Mary s arrival , he calls and leaves a message with Peter and Michael informing them of it and to keep it a secret per the director friend s wishes . When she arrives , they mistakenly believe she is the package , even though there is a note from her mother . Peter and Michael are totally befuddled on how to care for Mary , and Peter leaves to go buy whatever supplies are needed . While he is gone , Mrs. Hathaway ( Cynthia Harris ) , the landlady , delivers a small box ( which is the actual package containing heroin ) to the apartment and Michael tosses it aside while trying to keep Mary under control . After Peter returns , they eventually figure out her proper care , right down to diaper changes , baths , and feedings . The next day , two men ( who are drug dealers ) arrive at the apartment to pick up the package . Peter and Michael mistakenly give Mary to them instead , and shortly after they leave , Peter discovers the actual package . He runs downstairs to intercept them , but trips and stumbles , and the package s contents spill . He gathers it and retrieves Mary from them , but retains the heroin while allowing them to take a can of powdered milk . After the exchange , a police officer attempts to ticket them for illegal parking , but they escape . He accosts Peter and detains him in the apartment until Sgt . Melkowitz ( Philip Bosco ) , a narcotics officer , arrives to question him and Michael about the drugs . They successfully hide them from him during the interrogation , in which they learn that Jack s friend is a drug dealer as well . He leaves with suspicions and puts them and the apartment under surveillance . Peter and Michael are able to persuade Mrs. Hathaway to babysit Mary while they work . Once they get home , however , they find her bound and gagged and the apartment ransacked , apparently by the dealers demanding the heroin . Mary is safe , however . They continue with their care of her , adjusting to surrogate fatherhood and growing attached to her , until Jack returns . Once Jack returns , Peter and Michael question him about the entire drug deal and Mary . He replies that he knew nothing about the heroin and initially denies everything about Mary until he reads the note from Sylvia . He then recalls the tryst that eventually led to her being born . Peter and Michael do not hesitate in taking their revenge and passing all responsibility of looking after her to him , but he quickly grows to love her . Later , Peter discovers in the mail a news clipping of Jack s director friend being hospitalized after a mugging ( presumably by the drug dealers ) , with a handwritten note , Do n't let this happen to you . They formulate a plan to meet and trap them when they negotiate a deal to deliver the illicit goods . With a recording of the conversation , they prove their innocence to Melkowitz and the dealers are arrested . By now , they have fully embraced their role as Mary s guardians . However , one morning , Sylvia ( Nancy Travis ) arrives , asking for her back intending to take her to London to live with her family . Handing her over , they quickly find themselves miserable and desperately missing her . Deciding to stop her and Sylvia from leaving , they rush to the airport to try and persuade the latter to stay , but they arrive just as her plane is backing up from the gate . Defeated , they return home , where they find both Mary and Sylvia , who did not go to London after all . Sylvia tearfully explains she does n't want to give up her acting career but ca n't do so if she has to raise Mary alone , so Peter quickly invites her and Mary to move in with them with Jack and Michael s agreement , and she agrees .

With a recording of the conversation , they prove their innocence to Melkowitz and the dealers are arrested . By now , they have fully embraced their role as Mary s guardians . However , one morning , Sylvia ( Nancy Travis ) arrives , asking for her back intending to take her to London to live with her family . Handing her over , they quickly find themselves miserable and desperately missing her . Deciding to stop her and Sylvia from leaving , they rush to the airport to try and persuade the latter to stay , but they arrive just as her plane is backing up from the gate . Defeated , they return home , where they find both Mary and Sylvia , who did not go to London after all . Sylvia tearfully explains she does n't want to give up her acting career but ca n't do so if she has to raise Mary alone , so Peter quickly invites her and Mary to move in with them with Jack and Michael s agreement , and she agrees .


Architect Peter Mitchell ( Tom Selleck ) , cartoonist Michael Kellam ( Steve Guttenberg ) , and actor Jack Holden ( Ted Danson ) are happy living their lives as bachelors in their lofty New York City apartment where they have frequent parties and flings with different women . Their lives are disrupted when a baby named Mary arrives on their doorstep one day . A note with her , written by a lady named Sylvia , indicates that she is Jack s , the result of a tryst between the actor and actress . Mary arrives in his absence  he is in Turkey shooting a B movie , leaving Peter and Michael to fend for themselves in taking care of her . Prior to leaving , Jack had made arrangements with a director friend to have a package delivered to the apartment as a favor . Before Mary s arrival , he calls and leaves a message with Peter and Michael informing them of it and to keep it a secret per the director friend s wishes . When she arrives , they mistakenly believe she is the package , even though there is a note from her mother . Peter and Michael are totally befuddled on how to care for Mary , and Peter leaves to go buy whatever supplies are needed . While he is gone , Mrs. Hathaway ( Cynthia Harris ) , the landlady , delivers a small box ( which is the actual package containing heroin ) to the apartment and Michael tosses it aside while trying to keep Mary under control . After Peter returns , they eventually figure out her proper care , right down to diaper changes , baths , and feedings . The next day , two men ( who are drug dealers ) arrive at the apartment to pick up the package . Peter and Michael mistakenly give Mary to them instead , and shortly after they leave , Peter discovers the actual package . He runs downstairs to intercept them , but trips and stumbles , and the package s contents spill . He gathers it and retrieves Mary from them , but retains the heroin while allowing them to take a can of powdered milk . After the exchange , a police officer attempts to ticket them for illegal parking , but they escape . He accosts Peter and detains him in the apartment until Sgt . Melkowitz ( Philip Bosco ) , a narcotics officer , arrives to question him and Michael about the drugs . They successfully hide them from him during the interrogation , in which they learn that Jack s friend is a drug dealer as well . He leaves with suspicions and puts them and the apartment under surveillance . Peter and Michael are able to persuade Mrs. Hathaway to babysit Mary while they work . Once they get home , however , they find her bound and gagged and the apartment ransacked , apparently by the dealers demanding the heroin . Mary is safe , however . They continue with their care of her , adjusting to surrogate fatherhood and growing attached to her , until Jack returns . Once Jack returns , Peter and Michael question him about the entire drug deal and Mary . He replies that he knew nothing about the heroin and initially denies everything about Mary until he reads the note from Sylvia . He then recalls the tryst that eventually led to her being born . Peter and Michael do not hesitate in taking their revenge and passing all responsibility of looking after her to him , but he quickly grows to love her .

In 1959 , the four dead bodies of the Clutter family are discovered on their Kansas farm . While reading The New York Times , Truman Capote ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) is riveted by the story and calls The New Yorker magazine editor William Shawn ( Bob Balaban ) to tell him that he plans to document the tragedy . Capote travels to Kansas , inviting childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee ( Catherine Keener ) to come along . He intends to interview those involved with the Clutter family , with Lee as his go-between and facilitator . Alvin Dewey ( Chris Cooper ) , the Kansas Bureau of Investigation s lead detective on the case , brushes him off , but Dewey s wife Marie ( Amy Ryan ) is a fan of Capote s writing and persuades her husband to invite Capote and Lee to their house for dinner . Capote s stories of movie sets and film stars captivate Marie . Over time , her husband warms up to Capote and allows him to view the photographs of the victims . The Deweys , Lee , and Capote are having dinner when the murder suspects , Perry Smith ( Clifton Collins Jr. ) and Richard Dick Hickock ( Mark Pellegrino ) , are caught . Flattery , bribery , and a keen insight into the human condition facilitate Capote s visits to the prison where the accused are held . Capote begins to form an attachment to Smith . He informs Shawn of his intent to expand the story into a full-length book . Following the trial and conviction , Capote gains continued access to the murderers by bribing Warden Marshall Krutch ( Marshall Bell ) . Capote spends the following years regularly visiting Smith and learning about his life , excepting a year-long stint when he goes to Morocco and Spain to write the first three parts of the book , accompanied by his romantic partner Jack Dunphy ( Bruce Greenwood ) . The story of Smith s life , his remorseful manner , and his emotional sincerity impress Capote , who becomes emotionally attached to him despite the gruesome murders . Capote aids Smith and Hickock by obtaining expert legal counsel for them and initiating an appeal . Still he is frustrated , as Smith declines to relate exactly what happened on the night of the murders . Though initially an effort to provide proper representation and extend Capote s opportunity to speak with the killers , the appeals process drags on for several years . Without the court case being resolved , Capote feels he is stuck with a story without an ending , and he is unable to complete his book . Eventually he gets Smith to describe the killings and his thoughts at the time in great detail . He has what he wants from Smith , but in the process he sees a callousness and selfishness in his own actions . Now with everything in hand , Capote still must wait for the appeals process to conclude before he feels he can publish his work . In the course of time , Lee s best-selling novel To Kill a Mockingbird is turned into a movie , but Capote is unable to share in the joy of his friend s success , too caught up in drinking through his own misery . With the last appeal rejected , Smith pleads for Capote to return before he is executed , but Capote can not bring himself to do so . A telegram from Smith to Harper Lee ultimately compels Capote to return to Kansas . There he is an eyewitness as Smith and Hickock are executed . Capote talks to Lee about the horrifying experience and laments that he could not do anything to stop it . She replies , Maybe not . The fact is you did n't want to . The final scenes show Capote looking through photos from the case and at the writings and drawings given to him by Smith . An epilogue points out that In Cold Blood turned Capote into the most famous writer in America , also noting that he never finished another book .

In the course of time , Lee s best-selling novel To Kill a Mockingbird is turned into a movie , but Capote is unable to share in the joy of his friend s success , too caught up in drinking through his own misery . With the last appeal rejected , Smith pleads for Capote to return before he is executed , but Capote can not bring himself to do so . A telegram from Smith to Harper Lee ultimately compels Capote to return to Kansas . There he is an eyewitness as Smith and Hickock are executed . Capote talks to Lee about the horrifying experience and laments that he could not do anything to stop it . She replies , Maybe not . The fact is you did n't want to . The final scenes show Capote looking through photos from the case and at the writings and drawings given to him by Smith . An epilogue points out that In Cold Blood turned Capote into the most famous writer in America , also noting that he never finished another book .


In 1959 , the four dead bodies of the Clutter family are discovered on their Kansas farm . While reading The New York Times , Truman Capote ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) is riveted by the story and calls The New Yorker magazine editor William Shawn ( Bob Balaban ) to tell him that he plans to document the tragedy . Capote travels to Kansas , inviting childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee ( Catherine Keener ) to come along . He intends to interview those involved with the Clutter family , with Lee as his go-between and facilitator . Alvin Dewey ( Chris Cooper ) , the Kansas Bureau of Investigation s lead detective on the case , brushes him off , but Dewey s wife Marie ( Amy Ryan ) is a fan of Capote s writing and persuades her husband to invite Capote and Lee to their house for dinner . Capote s stories of movie sets and film stars captivate Marie . Over time , her husband warms up to Capote and allows him to view the photographs of the victims . The Deweys , Lee , and Capote are having dinner when the murder suspects , Perry Smith ( Clifton Collins Jr. ) and Richard Dick Hickock ( Mark Pellegrino ) , are caught . Flattery , bribery , and a keen insight into the human condition facilitate Capote s visits to the prison where the accused are held . Capote begins to form an attachment to Smith . He informs Shawn of his intent to expand the story into a full-length book . Following the trial and conviction , Capote gains continued access to the murderers by bribing Warden Marshall Krutch ( Marshall Bell ) . Capote spends the following years regularly visiting Smith and learning about his life , excepting a year-long stint when he goes to Morocco and Spain to write the first three parts of the book , accompanied by his romantic partner Jack Dunphy ( Bruce Greenwood ) . The story of Smith s life , his remorseful manner , and his emotional sincerity impress Capote , who becomes emotionally attached to him despite the gruesome murders . Capote aids Smith and Hickock by obtaining expert legal counsel for them and initiating an appeal . Still he is frustrated , as Smith declines to relate exactly what happened on the night of the murders . Though initially an effort to provide proper representation and extend Capote s opportunity to speak with the killers , the appeals process drags on for several years . Without the court case being resolved , Capote feels he is stuck with a story without an ending , and he is unable to complete his book . Eventually he gets Smith to describe the killings and his thoughts at the time in great detail .

Anne leaves Green Gables and her work as a teacher in Avonlea to pursue her original dream ( which she gave up in Anne of Green Gables ) of taking further education at Redmond College in Nova Scotia . Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane enroll as well , as does Anne s friend from Queen s Academy , Priscilla Grant . During her first week of school , Anne befriends Philippa Gordon , a beautiful girl whose frivolous ways charm her . Philippa ( Phil for short ) also happens to be from Anne s birthplace in Bolingbroke , Nova Scotia . The girls spend their first year in boardinghouses and decide to set up house thereafter in a lovely cottage called Patty s Place , near campus . The girls enter their second year at Redmond happily ensconced at Patty s Place , along with Queen s classmate Stella Maynard and her Aunt Jimsie ( their chaperone ) , while life continues in Avonlea . Diana Barry becomes engaged to Fred Wright and Davy and Dora continue to keep Marilla busy . Midway through their college years , Gilbert Blythe , who has always loved Anne , proposes to her but Anne rejects him ; although she and Gilbert are very close , she holds sentimental fantasies about true love ( all featuring a tall , dark , handsome , inscrutable hero ) and does not recognize her true feelings for Gilbert . Gilbert leaves , his heart broken , and the two drift apart . Anne s childhood friend Ruby Gillis dies of consumption very soon after finding her own true love . Anne later welcomes the courtship of Roy Gardiner , a darkly handsome Redmond student who showers her with attention and poetic gestures . However , when he proposes after two years , Anne abruptly realizes that Roy does not really belong in her life , and that she had only been in love with the idea of him as the embodiment of her romantic image of love . Anne is so ashamed in how she treated Roy that she feels her entire Redmond experience may have been spoiled . She returns to Green Gables , a full-fledged B.A . , but finds herself a bit lonely . Diana gives birth to her first child , and Jane Andrews , an old school friend , marries a Winnipeg millionaire . Having received an offer to be the principal of the Summerside school in the fall , Anne is keeping herself occupied over the summer when she learns that Gilbert is gravely ill with typhoid fever . With shock , Anne finally realizes how deep her true feelings for Gilbert are , and endures a white night of fear that he will leave this world without knowing that she does care . In the morning , Anne gratefully learns that Gilbert will survive . Gilbert recovers over the summer , bolstered by a letter from Phil assuring him that there is really nothing between Anne and Roy . After several visits to Green Gables , Gilbert and Anne take a late summer walk in Hester Gray s garden , and finally become engaged .

Painter Claude Lantier advocates painting real subjects in real places , most notably outdoors . This is in stark contrast to the artistic establishment , where artists painted in the studio and concentrated on mythological , historical and religious subjects . His art making is revolutionary and he has a small circle of like-minded friends equally intent on shaking up the art world and challenging the establishment . His best friends are his childhood comrades Pierre Sandoz , novelist and Louis Dubuche , an architect . Like Zola , Sandoz contemplates a series of novels about a family based in science and incorporating modern people and everyday lives . Dubuche is not half as bold as Claude and , although a painter , finds music to be his passion . He chooses a more conventional course , opting for the security of a middle-class life and a bourgeois marriage . Sandoz also pursues marriage  not for love but stability and to better understand what he is writing about . The outcry in the artistic community over the sidelining of new artists in favor of popular , established , traditional artists at the annual Salon of the Acadmie des Beaux-Arts leads to the creation of a Salon des Refuss for the rejected artists to display their work . No painting gathers more interest or generates more criticism than Claude s . Entitled Plein Air ( Open Air ) , it depicts a nude female figure in the front center and two female nudes in the background , with a fully dressed man , back to the viewer in the foreground . ( Zola deliberately invokes Le djeuner sur l'herbe by douard Manet , which provoked outcries at the actual Salon des Refuss in 1863 . ) Claude moves to the country to soak up more of the Open Air ' atmosphere he revelled in as a child and to create more masterpieces . Accompanying him is Christine Hallegrain , who served as the model for Claude s nude and they have a son . Claude is unable to paint much and grows more and more depressed . For the sake of his health , Christine convinces him to return to Paris . Claude has three paintings in three years rejected by the Salon before a spectacular view of the le de la Cit captures his imagination . He becomes obsessed with this vision and constructs a massive canvas on which to paint his masterpiece . He is unable to project his ideas successfully or combine them into a meaningful whole . He begins adding incongruous elements ( like a female nude bather ) , reworks and repaints until the whole enterprise collapses into disaster , then starts over . His inability to create his masterpiece deepens his depression . The slow breakup of his circle of friends contributes to his decaying mental state , as does the success of one of his confreres , a lesser talent who has co-opted the Open Air ' school and made it a critical and financial triumph . Christine , whom he has at last married , watches as the painting  and especially the nude  begins to destroy his soul . When their son dies , Claude is inspired to paint a picture of the dead body that is accepted by the Salon ( after considerable politicking ) . The painting is ridiculed for its subject and its execution and Claude again turns to his huge landscape . Christine watches as he spirals further into obsession and madness . A last-ditch effort to free him from Art in general and from his wished-for masterpiece in particular has an effect but in the end Claude hangs himself from his scaffolding . The only ones of his old friends who attend his funeral are Sandoz and Bongrand , an elder statesman of the artistic community who recognized and helped nurture Claude s genius .

Claude has three paintings in three years rejected by the Salon before a spectacular view of the le de la Cit captures his imagination .

Painter Claude Lantier advocates painting real subjects in real places , most notably outdoors . This is in stark contrast to the artistic establishment , where artists painted in the studio and concentrated on mythological , historical and religious subjects . His art making is revolutionary and he has a small circle of like-minded friends equally intent on shaking up the art world and challenging the establishment . His best friends are his childhood comrades Pierre Sandoz , novelist and Louis Dubuche , an architect . Like Zola , Sandoz contemplates a series of novels about a family based in science and incorporating modern people and everyday lives . Dubuche is not half as bold as Claude and , although a painter , finds music to be his passion . He chooses a more conventional course , opting for the security of a middle-class life and a bourgeois marriage . Sandoz also pursues marriage  not for love but stability and to better understand what he is writing about . The outcry in the artistic community over the sidelining of new artists in favor of popular , established , traditional artists at the annual Salon of the Acadmie des Beaux-Arts leads to the creation of a Salon des Refuss for the rejected artists to display their work .

Sir Leicester Dedlock and his wife Lady Honoria live on his estate at Chesney Wold . Unknown to Sir Leicester , Lady Dedlock had a lover , Captain Hawdon , before she married  and had a daughter by him . Lady Dedlock believes her daughter is dead . The daughter , Esther , is in fact alive , and being raised by Miss Barbary , Lady Dedlock s sister . Esther does not know Miss Barbary is her aunt . After Miss Barbary dies , John Jarndyce becomes Esther s guardian and assigns the Chancery lawyer Conversation Kenge to take charge of her future . After attending school for six years , Esther moves in with him at Bleak House . Jarndyce simultaneously assumes custody of two other wards , Richard Carstone and Ada Clare ( Esther s cousins ) . They are beneficiaries in one of the wills at issue in Jarndyce and Jarndyce ; their guardian is a beneficiary under another will , and the two wills conflict . Richard and Ada soon fall in love , but though Mr. Jarndyce does n't oppose the match , he stipulates that Richard must first choose a profession . Richard first tries a career in medicine , and Esther meets Mr. Allan Woodcourt at the house of Richard s tutor . When Richard mentions the prospect of gaining from the resolution of Jarndyce and Jarndyce , John Jarndyce beseeches him never to put faith in what he calls the family curse . Meanwhile , Lady Dedlock is also a beneficiary under one of the wills . Early in the book , while listening to the reading of an affidavit by the family solicitor Mr. Tulkinghorn , she recognises the handwriting on the copy . The sight affects her so much she almost faints , which Tulkinghorn notices and investigates . He traces the copyist , a pauper known only as Nemo , in London . Nemo has recently died , and the only person to identify him is a street-sweeper , a poor homeless boy named Jo , who lives in Tom-All-Alone s . Lady Dedlock is also investigating , disguised as her maid , Hortense . She pays Jo to take her to Nemo s grave . Meanwhile , Tulkinghorn is concerned Lady Dedlock s secret could threaten the interests of Sir Leicester , and watches her constantly , even enlisting her maid to spy on her . He also enlists Inspector Bucket to run Jo out of town , so that there are no loose ends that might connect Nemo to the Dedlocks . Esther sees Lady Dedlock at church and talks with her later at Chesney Wold  though neither woman recognises their connection . Later , Lady Dedlock does discover that Esther is her child . However Esther has become sick ( possibly with smallpox , since it permanently disfigures her ) after nursing the homeless boy Jo . Lady Dedlock waits until she has recovered before telling her the truth . Though Esther and Lady Dedlock are happy to be reunited , Lady Dedlock tells Esther they must never acknowledge their connection again . On her recovery , Esther finds that Richard , having failed at several professions , has disobeyed his guardian and is trying to push Jarndyce and Jarndyce to conclusion in his and Ada s favour . In the process , Richard loses all his money and declines in health . He and Ada have secretly married , and Ada is pregnant . Esther has her own romance when Mr. Woodcourt returns to England , having survived a shipwreck , and continues to seek her company despite her disfigurement . Unfortunately , Esther has already agreed to marry her guardian , John Jarndyce . Hortense and Tulkinghorn discover the truth about Lady Dedlock s past . After a confrontation with Tulkinghorn , Lady Dedlock flees her home , leaving a note apologising for her conduct . Tulkinghorn dismisses Hortense , who is no longer of any use to him . Feeling abandoned and betrayed , Hortense kills Tulkinghorn and seeks to frame Lady Dedlock for his murder . Sir Leicester , discovering his lawyer s death and his wife s flight , suffers a catastrophic stroke , but he manages to communicate that he forgives his wife and wants her to return . Inspector Bucket , who has previously investigated several matters related to Jarndyce and Jarndyce , accepts Sir Leicester s commission to find Lady Dedlock . At first he suspects Lady Dedlock of the murder , but is able to clear her of suspicion after discovering Hortense s guilt , and asks Esther s help to find her . Lady Dedlock has no way to know of her husband s forgiveness or that she has been cleared of suspicion , and she wanders the country in cold weather before dying at the cemetery of her former lover Captain Hawdon ( Nemo ) . Esther and Bucket find her there . Progress in Jarndyce and Jarndyce seem to take a turn for the better when a later will is found , which revokes all previous wills and leaves the bulk of the estate to Richard and Ada . Meanwhile , John Jarndyce cancels his engagement to Esther , who becomes engaged to Mr. Woodcourt . They go to Chancery to find Richard . On their arrival , they learn that the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is finally over , but the costs of litigation have entirely consumed the estate . Richard collapses , and Mr. Woodcourt diagnoses him as being in the last stages of tuberculosis . Richard apologises to John Jarndyce and dies . Jarndyce takes in Ada and her child , a boy whom she names Richard . Esther and Woodcourt marry and live in a Yorkshire house which Jarndyce gives to them . The couple later raise two daughters . Many of the novel s subplots focus on minor characters . One such subplot is the hard life and happy , though difficult , marriage of Caddy Jellyby and Prince Turveydrop . Another plot focuses on George Rouncewell s rediscovery of his family and his reunion with his mother and brother .

Jarndyce takes in Ada and her child , a boy whom she names Richard . Esther and Woodcourt marry and live in a Yorkshire house which Jarndyce gives to them . The couple later raise two daughters .

Sir Leicester Dedlock and his wife Lady Honoria live on his estate at Chesney Wold . Unknown to Sir Leicester , Lady Dedlock had a lover , Captain Hawdon , before she married  and had a daughter by him . Lady Dedlock believes her daughter is dead . The daughter , Esther , is in fact alive , and being raised by Miss Barbary , Lady Dedlock s sister . Esther does not know Miss Barbary is her aunt . After Miss Barbary dies , John Jarndyce becomes Esther s guardian and assigns the Chancery lawyer Conversation Kenge to take charge of her future . After attending school for six years , Esther moves in with him at Bleak House . Jarndyce simultaneously assumes custody of two other wards , Richard Carstone and Ada Clare ( Esther s cousins ) . They are beneficiaries in one of the wills at issue in Jarndyce and Jarndyce ; their guardian is a beneficiary under another will , and the two wills conflict . Richard and Ada soon fall in love , but though Mr. Jarndyce does n't oppose the match , he stipulates that Richard must first choose a profession . Richard first tries a career in medicine , and Esther meets Mr. Allan Woodcourt at the house of Richard s tutor . When Richard mentions the prospect of gaining from the resolution of Jarndyce and Jarndyce , John Jarndyce beseeches him never to put faith in what he calls the family curse . Meanwhile , Lady Dedlock is also a beneficiary under one of the wills . Early in the book , while listening to the reading of an affidavit by the family solicitor Mr. Tulkinghorn , she recognises the handwriting on the copy . The sight affects her so much she almost faints , which Tulkinghorn notices and investigates . He traces the copyist , a pauper known only as Nemo , in London . Nemo has recently died , and the only person to identify him is a street-sweeper , a poor homeless boy named Jo , who lives in Tom-All-Alone s . Lady Dedlock is also investigating , disguised as her maid , Hortense . She pays Jo to take her to Nemo s grave . Meanwhile , Tulkinghorn is concerned Lady Dedlock s secret could threaten the interests of Sir Leicester , and watches her constantly , even enlisting her maid to spy on her . He also enlists Inspector Bucket to run Jo out of town , so that there are no loose ends that might connect Nemo to the Dedlocks . Esther sees Lady Dedlock at church and talks with her later at Chesney Wold  though neither woman recognises their connection . Later , Lady Dedlock does discover that Esther is her child . However Esther has become sick ( possibly with smallpox , since it permanently disfigures her ) after nursing the homeless boy Jo . Lady Dedlock waits until she has recovered before telling her the truth . Though Esther and Lady Dedlock are happy to be reunited , Lady Dedlock tells Esther they must never acknowledge their connection again . On her recovery , Esther finds that Richard , having failed at several professions , has disobeyed his guardian and is trying to push Jarndyce and Jarndyce to conclusion in his and Ada s favour . In the process , Richard loses all his money and declines in health . He and Ada have secretly married , and Ada is pregnant . Esther has her own romance when Mr. Woodcourt returns to England , having survived a shipwreck , and continues to seek her company despite her disfigurement . Unfortunately , Esther has already agreed to marry her guardian , John Jarndyce . Hortense and Tulkinghorn discover the truth about Lady Dedlock s past . After a confrontation with Tulkinghorn , Lady Dedlock flees her home , leaving a note apologising for her conduct . Tulkinghorn dismisses Hortense , who is no longer of any use to him . Feeling abandoned and betrayed , Hortense kills Tulkinghorn and seeks to frame Lady Dedlock for his murder . Sir Leicester , discovering his lawyer s death and his wife s flight , suffers a catastrophic stroke , but he manages to communicate that he forgives his wife and wants her to return . Inspector Bucket , who has previously investigated several matters related to Jarndyce and Jarndyce , accepts Sir Leicester s commission to find Lady Dedlock . At first he suspects Lady Dedlock of the murder , but is able to clear her of suspicion after discovering Hortense s guilt , and asks Esther s help to find her . Lady Dedlock has no way to know of her husband s forgiveness or that she has been cleared of suspicion , and she wanders the country in cold weather before dying at the cemetery of her former lover Captain Hawdon ( Nemo ) . Esther and Bucket find her there . Progress in Jarndyce and Jarndyce seem to take a turn for the better when a later will is found , which revokes all previous wills and leaves the bulk of the estate to Richard and Ada . Meanwhile , John Jarndyce cancels his engagement to Esther , who becomes engaged to Mr. Woodcourt . They go to Chancery to find Richard . On their arrival , they learn that the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is finally over , but the costs of litigation have entirely consumed the estate .

Disillusioned knight Antonius Block ( Max von Sydow ) and his nihilistic squire Jns ( Gunnar Bjrnstrand ) return after fighting in the Crusades and find Sweden being ravaged by the plague . On the beach immediately after their arrival , the knight encounters Death ( Bengt Ekerot ) , personified as a pale , black-cowled figure resembling a monk . The knight , in the middle of a chess game he has been playing alone , challenges Death to a chess match , believing that he can forestall his demise as long as the game continues . Death agrees , and they start a new game . The other characters in the story , except for Jof in the end , do not see Death , and when the chess board comes out at various times in the story , they believe the knight is continuing his habit of playing alone . The knight with his squire heads for his castle . Along the way , they pass some actors , Jof ( Nils Poppe ) and his wife Mia ( Bibi Andersson ) , with their infant son , Mikael , and their actor-manager , Skat ( Erik Strandmark ) . Jof is also a juggler and has visions of Jesus and Mary , but Mia is skeptical of them . The knight and squire enter a church where a fresco of the Dance of Death is being painted . The squire draws a small figure representing himself . The knight goes to the confessional where he is joined by Death in the robe of a priest , to whom he admits that his life has been futile and without meaning , but that he wants to perform one meaningful deed . Upon revealing the chess strategy that will save his life , the knight discovers that the priest is Death , who promises to remember the tactics . Leaving the church , the knight speaks to a young woman ( Maud Hansson ) who has been condemned to be burned at the stake for consorting with the devil . Shortly thereafter , the squire searches an abandoned village for water . He saves a servant girl ( Gunnel Lindblom ) from being raped by a man robbing a corpse . He recognizes the man as Raval ( Bertil Anderberg ) , a theologian , who 10 years prior had convinced the knight to leave his wife and join a crusade to the Holy Land . The squire promises to brand the theologian on the face if they meet again . The servant girl joins the squire . The trio ride into town , where the actors met earlier are performing . The actor-manager introduces the other actors to the crowd , then is enticed by Lisa ( Inga Gill ) , the blacksmith s wife , away for a tryst . They run off together . The actors performance is interrupted by the arrival of a procession of flagellants . At a public house , the juggler meets Raval who forces him to dance on the tables like a bear . The squire appears and , true to his word , slices the theologian s face . The knight enjoys a country picnic of milk and wild strawberries gathered by the wife of the juggler . The knight says : I ll carry this memory between my hands as if it were bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk ... And it will be an adequate sign  it will be enough for me . He invites the actors to his castle , where they will be safer from the plague . Along the way , they come across the actor-manager and the blacksmith s wife in the forest . Dissatisfied with him , she returns to her husband . After the others leave , the actor-manager climbs a tree for the night . Death cuts down the tree , informing the actor that his time is up . They pass the condemned young woman again . The knight asks the woman again to summon Satan , so he can ask him about God . The girl claims already to have done so , but the knight can not see him , only her terror . He gives her herbs to take away her pain . The theologian reappears . Dying of the plague , he pleads for water . The servant girl attempts to bring him some , but the squire stops her . The juggler tells his wife that he can see the knight playing chess with Death , and decides to flee with his family while Death is preoccupied . After hearing Death state No one escapes me the knight knocks the chess pieces over , distracting Death while the family slips away . Death places the pieces back on the board , then wins the game on the next move . He announces that when they meet again , the knight s timeand that of all those traveling with himwill be up . Before departing , Death asks if the knight has accomplished his one meaningful deed yet ; The Knight replies that he has . The knight is reunited with his wife , Karin ( Inga Landgr ) , the sole occupant of his castle , all the servants having fled . The party shares one last supper before Death comes for them . The knight prays to God , Have mercy on us , because we are small and frightened and ignorant . Meanwhile , the little family sits out a storm , which the juggler interprets to be the Angel of Death and he s very big . The next morning , the juggler , with his second sight , sees the knight and his followers being led away over the hills in a solemn dance of death .

The knight prays to God , Have mercy on us , because we are small and frightened and ignorant . Meanwhile , the little family sits out a storm , which the juggler interprets to be the Angel of Death and he s very big . The next morning , the juggler , with his second sight , sees the knight and his followers being led away over the hills in a solemn dance of death .


Disillusioned knight Antonius Block ( Max von Sydow ) and his nihilistic squire Jns ( Gunnar Bjrnstrand ) return after fighting in the Crusades and find Sweden being ravaged by the plague . On the beach immediately after their arrival , the knight encounters Death ( Bengt Ekerot ) , personified as a pale , black-cowled figure resembling a monk . The knight , in the middle of a chess game he has been playing alone , challenges Death to a chess match , believing that he can forestall his demise as long as the game continues . Death agrees , and they start a new game . The other characters in the story , except for Jof in the end , do not see Death , and when the chess board comes out at various times in the story , they believe the knight is continuing his habit of playing alone . The knight with his squire heads for his castle . Along the way , they pass some actors , Jof ( Nils Poppe ) and his wife Mia ( Bibi Andersson ) , with their infant son , Mikael , and their actor-manager , Skat ( Erik Strandmark ) . Jof is also a juggler and has visions of Jesus and Mary , but Mia is skeptical of them . The knight and squire enter a church where a fresco of the Dance of Death is being painted . The squire draws a small figure representing himself . The knight goes to the confessional where he is joined by Death in the robe of a priest , to whom he admits that his life has been futile and without meaning , but that he wants to perform one meaningful deed . Upon revealing the chess strategy that will save his life , the knight discovers that the priest is Death , who promises to remember the tactics . Leaving the church , the knight speaks to a young woman ( Maud Hansson ) who has been condemned to be burned at the stake for consorting with the devil . Shortly thereafter , the squire searches an abandoned village for water . He saves a servant girl ( Gunnel Lindblom ) from being raped by a man robbing a corpse . He recognizes the man as Raval ( Bertil Anderberg ) , a theologian , who 10 years prior had convinced the knight to leave his wife and join a crusade to the Holy Land . The squire promises to brand the theologian on the face if they meet again . The servant girl joins the squire . The trio ride into town , where the actors met earlier are performing . The actor-manager introduces the other actors to the crowd , then is enticed by Lisa ( Inga Gill ) , the blacksmith s wife , away for a tryst . They run off together . The actors performance is interrupted by the arrival of a procession of flagellants . At a public house , the juggler meets Raval who forces him to dance on the tables like a bear . The squire appears and , true to his word , slices the theologian s face . The knight enjoys a country picnic of milk and wild strawberries gathered by the wife of the juggler . The knight says : I ll carry this memory between my hands as if it were bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk ... And it will be an adequate sign  it will be enough for me . He invites the actors to his castle , where they will be safer from the plague . Along the way , they come across the actor-manager and the blacksmith s wife in the forest . Dissatisfied with him , she returns to her husband . After the others leave , the actor-manager climbs a tree for the night . Death cuts down the tree , informing the actor that his time is up . They pass the condemned young woman again . The knight asks the woman again to summon Satan , so he can ask him about God . The girl claims already to have done so , but the knight can not see him , only her terror . He gives her herbs to take away her pain . The theologian reappears . Dying of the plague , he pleads for water . The servant girl attempts to bring him some , but the squire stops her . The juggler tells his wife that he can see the knight playing chess with Death , and decides to flee with his family while Death is preoccupied .

With supplies of petroleum nearly exhausted in the near future following a major energy crisis and a global nuclear war , ex-Main Force Patrol officer Mad Max Rockatansky ( Mel Gibson ) roams the now-depopulated and desolate desert in his scarred , black supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special several years after the events of the first film , scavenging for food , water , and fuel . His only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog and a rare functioning firearm  a sawn-off shotgun  for which ammunition is very scarce . While trying to escape a group of gang members  led by a crazed motorcycle rider named Wez ( Vernon Wells ) - Max manages to crash two of the gang member s vehicles and injure Wez ; recognising his defeat , Wez flees . After collecting some fuel from the destroyed cars and checking a nearby Mack semi , Max inspects a nearby autogyro for fuel . Its pilot , the Gyro Captain ( Bruce Spence ) , ambushes Max and manages to capture him briefly before being overpowered . In exchange for his own life , the pilot guides Max to a small oil refinery nearby . Max arrives to see the facility is under siege by a gang of marauders riding a motley collection of cars and motorbikes . The gang leader , known as Lord Humungus ( Kjell Nilsson ) , tries to convince the refinery s defenders to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of the area . A group of defenders attempts to break out of the compound , but the marauders capture , torture , and kill all but one of them , who is rescued by Max . Max makes a deal with the mortally-wounded sole survivor : he will bring him back to the compound in exchange for a tank of fuel . The man dies shortly after they enter the facility , and the facility leader , Pappagallo ( Michael Preston ) , reneges on the deal , saying it died when the survivor died . His group is on the verge of killing Max when the marauders return , and Humungus repeats his offer . When the Feral Kid ( Emil Minty ) kills Wez s male companion , Wez becomes enraged , urging his leader to take the compound ; Humungus wrestles Wez into submission , but placates Wez by revealing he has no intention of letting any of the settlers leave . Max offers Pappagallo a different deal : he will retrieve the abandoned Mack semi-truck , which is capable of hauling the tanker trailer that the facility inhabitants use to store the fuel they refine , in exchange for freedom , his vehicle , and as much fuel as he can take with him . The group accepts , but keeps Max s car to ensure his co-operation . Max sneaks out , locating the Gyro Captain ( dragging the branch he is chained to ) and conscripts him to help find the truck using his gyrocopter . After finding the truck , Max drives it back to the compound , evading Humungus s men . The defenders want Max to escape with the group , but Max opts to collect his petrol and leave . However , his attempt to break through the siege fails : Wez gives chase in Humungus s nitrous oxide-equipped car and runs Max off the road , wrecking his vehicle and severely injuring him . The marauders kill Max s dog with a crossbow , then attempt to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special s tanks , but trigger an explosive booby trap , which kills some of the attackers . Left for dead , Max is rescued by the Gyro Captain as he is trying to crawl back to the refinery . With no other means of escape and with the refinery s defenders preparing to depart , Max insists on driving the repaired truck . He leaves the compound in the heavily-armoured truck , accompanied by the Feral Kid he has befriended and by other inhabitants aboard as defenders . Pappagallo escorts him out in a captured marauder vehicle . Humungus and most of his warriors pursue the tanker , leaving the remaining inhabitants free to flee the compound in a ramshackle caravan and buses , blowing up the refinery as they leave . Pappagallo and the other defenders of the tanker , as well as numerous marauders , are killed during the chase and the Gyro Captain is shot down . Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone , pursued by the marauders . Wez manages to board the truck and attack Max , but a head-on collision with Humungus s car kills both Wez and Humungus . Max loses control of the tanker and it rolls off the road . As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker , he sees not petrol , but sand , leaking from the tank . The truck and its trailer are thus exposed as a decoy , allowing the other settlers to escape with the precious fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles . With Pappagallo dead , the Gyro Captain succeeds him as their chief and leads the settlers to the coast , where they establish the Great Northern Tribe . Max remains alone in the desert , once again becoming a drifter . Years later , the Feral Kid , now the Northern Tribe s new leader ( voice by Harold Baigent ) , reminisces about the legend of the mythical Road Warrior ( Max ) who now exists only in distant memory .

While trying to escape a group of gang members  led by a crazed motorcycle rider named Wez ( Vernon Wells ) - Max manages to crash two of the gang member s vehicles and injure Wez ; recognising his defeat , Wez flees . After collecting some fuel from the destroyed cars and checking a nearby Mack semi , Max inspects a nearby autogyro for fuel . Its pilot , the Gyro Captain ( Bruce Spence ) , ambushes Max and manages to capture him briefly before being overpowered . In exchange for his own life , the pilot guides Max to a small oil refinery nearby . Max arrives to see the facility is under siege by a gang of marauders riding a motley collection of cars and motorbikes . The gang leader , known as Lord Humungus ( Kjell Nilsson ) , tries to convince the refinery s defenders to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of the area . A group of defenders attempts to break out of the compound , but the marauders capture , torture , and kill all but one of them , who is rescued by Max . Max makes a deal with the mortally-wounded sole survivor : he will bring him back to the compound in exchange for a tank of fuel . The man dies shortly after they enter the facility , and the facility leader , Pappagallo ( Michael Preston ) , reneges on the deal , saying it died when the survivor died . His group is on the verge of killing Max when the marauders return , and Humungus repeats his offer . When the Feral Kid ( Emil Minty ) kills Wez s male companion , Wez becomes enraged , urging his leader to take the compound ; Humungus wrestles Wez into submission , but placates Wez by revealing he has no intention of letting any of the settlers leave . Max offers Pappagallo a different deal : he will retrieve the abandoned Mack semi-truck , which is capable of hauling the tanker trailer that the facility inhabitants use to store the fuel they refine , in exchange for freedom , his vehicle , and as much fuel as he can take with him . The group accepts , but keeps Max s car to ensure his co-operation . Max sneaks out , locating the Gyro Captain ( dragging the branch he is chained to ) and conscripts him to help find the truck using his gyrocopter . After finding the truck , Max drives it back to the compound , evading Humungus s men . The defenders want Max to escape with the group , but Max opts to collect his petrol and leave . However , his attempt to break through the siege fails : Wez gives chase in Humungus s nitrous oxide-equipped car and runs Max off the road , wrecking his vehicle and severely injuring him . The marauders kill Max s dog with a crossbow , then attempt to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special s tanks , but trigger an explosive booby trap , which kills some of the attackers . Left for dead , Max is rescued by the Gyro Captain as he is trying to crawl back to the refinery . With no other means of escape and with the refinery s defenders preparing to depart , Max insists on driving the repaired truck . He leaves the compound in the heavily-armoured truck , accompanied by the Feral Kid he has befriended and by other inhabitants aboard as defenders . Pappagallo escorts him out in a captured marauder vehicle . Humungus and most of his warriors pursue the tanker , leaving the remaining inhabitants free to flee the compound in a ramshackle caravan and buses , blowing up the refinery as they leave . Pappagallo and the other defenders of the tanker , as well as numerous marauders , are killed during the chase and the Gyro Captain is shot down . Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone , pursued by the marauders . Wez manages to board the truck and attack Max , but a head-on collision with Humungus s car kills both Wez and Humungus . Max loses control of the tanker and it rolls off the road . As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker , he sees not petrol , but sand , leaking from the tank . The truck and its trailer are thus exposed as a decoy , allowing the other settlers to escape with the precious fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles . With Pappagallo dead , the Gyro Captain succeeds him as their chief and leads the settlers to the coast , where they establish the Great Northern Tribe . Max remains alone in the desert , once again becoming a drifter . Years later , the Feral Kid , now the Northern Tribe s new leader ( voice by Harold Baigent ) , reminisces about the legend of the mythical Road Warrior ( Max ) who now exists only in distant memory .

A group of defenders attempts to break out of the compound , but the marauders capture , torture , and kill all but one of them , who is rescued by Max . Max makes a deal with the mortally-wounded sole survivor : he will bring him back to the compound in exchange for a tank of fuel . The man dies shortly after they enter the facility , and the facility leader , Pappagallo ( Michael Preston ) , reneges on the deal , saying it died when the survivor died . His group is on the verge of killing Max when the marauders return , and Humungus repeats his offer . When the Feral Kid ( Emil Minty ) kills Wez s male companion , Wez becomes enraged , urging his leader to take the compound ; Humungus wrestles Wez into submission , but placates Wez by revealing he has no intention of letting any of the settlers leave . Max offers Pappagallo a different deal : he will retrieve the abandoned Mack semi-truck , which is capable of hauling the tanker trailer that the facility inhabitants use to store the fuel they refine , in exchange for freedom , his vehicle , and as much fuel as he can take with him . The group accepts , but keeps Max s car to ensure his co-operation . Max sneaks out , locating the Gyro Captain ( dragging the branch he is chained to ) and conscripts him to help find the truck using his gyrocopter . After finding the truck , Max drives it back to the compound , evading Humungus s men . The defenders want Max to escape with the group , but Max opts to collect his petrol and leave . However , his attempt to break through the siege fails : Wez gives chase in Humungus s nitrous oxide-equipped car and runs Max off the road , wrecking his vehicle and severely injuring him . The marauders kill Max s dog with a crossbow , then attempt to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special s tanks , but trigger an explosive booby trap , which kills some of the attackers . Left for dead , Max is rescued by the Gyro Captain as he is trying to crawl back to the refinery . With no other means of escape and with the refinery s defenders preparing to depart , Max insists on driving the repaired truck . He leaves the compound in the heavily-armoured truck , accompanied by the Feral Kid he has befriended and by other inhabitants aboard as defenders . Pappagallo escorts him out in a captured marauder vehicle . Humungus and most of his warriors pursue the tanker , leaving the remaining inhabitants free to flee the compound in a ramshackle caravan and buses , blowing up the refinery as they leave . Pappagallo and the other defenders of the tanker , as well as numerous marauders , are killed during the chase and the Gyro Captain is shot down . Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone , pursued by the marauders . Wez manages to board the truck and attack Max , but a head-on collision with Humungus s car kills both Wez and Humungus . Max loses control of the tanker and it rolls off the road . As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker , he sees not petrol , but sand , leaking from the tank . The truck and its trailer are thus exposed as a decoy , allowing the other settlers to escape with the precious fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles . With Pappagallo dead , the Gyro Captain succeeds him as their chief and leads the settlers to the coast , where they establish the Great Northern Tribe . Max remains alone in the desert , once again becoming a drifter . Years later , the Feral Kid , now the Northern Tribe s new leader ( voice by Harold Baigent ) , reminisces about the legend of the mythical Road Warrior ( Max ) who now exists only in distant memory .


With supplies of petroleum nearly exhausted in the near future following a major energy crisis and a global nuclear war , ex-Main Force Patrol officer Mad Max Rockatansky ( Mel Gibson ) roams the now-depopulated and desolate desert in his scarred , black supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special several years after the events of the first film , scavenging for food , water , and fuel . His only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog and a rare functioning firearm  a sawn-off shotgun  for which ammunition is very scarce . While trying to escape a group of gang members  led by a crazed motorcycle rider named Wez ( Vernon Wells ) - Max manages to crash two of the gang member s vehicles and injure Wez ; recognising his defeat , Wez flees . After collecting some fuel from the destroyed cars and checking a nearby Mack semi , Max inspects a nearby autogyro for fuel . Its pilot , the Gyro Captain ( Bruce Spence ) , ambushes Max and manages to capture him briefly before being overpowered . In exchange for his own life , the pilot guides Max to a small oil refinery nearby . Max arrives to see the facility is under siege by a gang of marauders riding a motley collection of cars and motorbikes . The gang leader , known as Lord Humungus ( Kjell Nilsson ) , tries to convince the refinery s defenders to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of the area . A group of defenders attempts to break out of the compound , but the marauders capture , torture , and kill all but one of them , who is rescued by Max .

On a wet rainy night in Chicago , police officer Sharon Pogue ( Jennifer Lopez ) is at the scene of a serious traffic accident holding the hand of one of the victims , pleading that he hold on and not give up . One year later , Sharon is frustrated with the men she dates , and has become estranged from her family for having her father arrested for beating her mother Josephine ( Sonia Braga ) . Her father and brother , Larry ( Jeremy Sisto ) , have never forgiven her , and her anger is affecting her police work . A man known only as Catch ( Jim Caviezel ) wanders the streets of Chicago in a trance-like state , doing good deeds for strangers and neighbors . One day he sees Sharon at a diner and watches her from across the street , and she notices him watching her . Just then a car pulls up and blasts the diner with machine gun fire , and Sharon and her partner chase after the criminals . Sharon catches up with one criminal and in the ensuing struggle , he gets her gun and shoots her twice in the chest . Seeing that she is protected by her bulletproof vest , he prepares to shoot her in the head , but Catch jumps the man and knocks the gun away , saving her life . That night , Sharon and Catch meet at a tavern and have a drink . A grateful Sharon tries to learn more about Catch , but he does not talk about himself . Sharon invites him to her apartment , and after some awkward moments between the two , they share a kiss . Catch abruptly stops and leaves the apartment , leaving Sharon confused . The next evening Sharon finds a dandelion taped to her mailbox with Catch s phone number . She calls and awkwardly invites him to breakfast at a coffee shop the next morning . When Sharon wakes up , she has second thoughts and calls Catch to cancel their breakfast date . Catch is already at the coffee shop and never gets the message . Upset at being stood up , he goes to Sharon s apartment and criticizes her for not showing up for her appointment , and then storms out . Sharon follows him to his nearly empty apartment . Surprised at the living conditions , she demands to know more about him , but Catch refuses to reveal anything about his past . He only says that he is starting from scratch . Following the advice of his mother-in-law , Catch calls Sharon and apologizes , and the two continue seeing each other . They go on a lakeside picnic in a state park and share a romantic swim , after which they make passionate love on the shore . In the coming days , Catch is there to comfort her after a family confrontation . His positive influence begins to show in her police work . One night they go to a blues club , and after the band has played a number , Catch notices a trumpet sitting on the bandstand . He picks up the trumpet and starts to play a soulful version of the tune Nature Boy . As they re leaving , the owner approaches him , calling him Steve Lambert , and asking where s he s been . Catch denies even knowing the man and walks away . The next day , Sharon investigates the name Steven Lambert in the police files and discovers that he is the man whose hand she held at the site of a traffic accident a year earlier , and that Catch s wife and child died in the accident . She goes to the house he abandoned after the accident and learns that he was a jazz musician and that the accident occurred on his son s birthday , causing Catch to create a mental block . Wanting to help Catch heal from his emotional wounds , she tries to talk to him about the accident and takes him to the cemetery to see the graves of his family , but he gets very upset and walks away . Sharon visits Catch s mother-in-law looking for some way of helping the man she loves , and she encourages patience and tells her that Catch will find his way in his own time . At her parents ' wedding vow renewal ceremony , Sharon tries talking to her father but he tells her that he feels like he does n't have a daughter . As Sharon starts to leave , she stops and tells the videographer a wonderful story about her father playing with her and her brother when they were children . She is deeply moved by this memory . Her father overhears it and is also emotionally affected , but when Sharon looks at him , he turns away . Meanwhile , Catch finally goes to the cemetery and talks to his deceased wife and child , explaining how he remembers all the wonderful moments they shared . As Sharon leaves the reception , she sees Catch waiting by her car . They embrace and profess their love for each other . As they prepare to leave , Catch tells her that he ll drive .

Jani shows him bruises saying she got them from gambling creditors and asks Jack to be the inside man for a planned robbery at the casino . All he has to do is raise the alarm when a gambler cheats at his table . Jack eventually agrees and accepts a 10,000 advance with an additional 10,000 if all goes well . In doing so , Jack notices that Jani s injuries were faked . Marion reconciles with Jack but discovers that he is involved in something criminal and tries to foil it . On the night of the robbery , Jack raises the alarm anyway and gets beaten by the gambler as a distraction while others try to grab the money . They fail , and Jack and Marion have an argument but she stays with him . When a late-night knock at the door comes , Jack assumes it to be the casino robbers demanding the return of their advance money . Instead , it is a policeman , who informs him that Marion has been killed in an apparent hit-and-run . Jack finishes his book and gets it published anonymously . It is a big success , but he does n't change anything about his life , continuing to work as a croupier and live in his basement flat , not even buying the new car he wanted . Jack goes on with his life and gets another call , this one from Jani , who congratulates him on playing his part in the attempted robbery and implies that she benefited significantly . Then she puts his father on the phone , and he implies that he set up the croupier job for Jack in order to arrange for the attempted robbery , and he benefited as well .

In a Californian forest , a group of alien botanists land in a spacecraft , collecting flora samples . When government agents appear on the scene , they flee in their spaceship , leaving one of their own behind in their haste . At a suburban home , a ten-year-old fatherless boy named Elliot , is trying to spend time with his brother , Michael , and his friends . As he returns from picking up a pizza , he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed . The creature promptly flees upon being discovered . Despite his family s disbelief , Elliot leaves Reese s Pieces candy to lure the creature to his bedroom . Before he goes to sleep , he realizes it is imitating his movements . He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it . Later that day , Michael and their five-year-old sister , Gertie , meet it . They decide to keep it hidden from their mother , Mary . When they ask it about its origin , it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving a dead chrysanthemum . At school the next day , Elliot begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien , including exhibiting signs of intoxication ( because it is at his home , drinking beer ) , and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class . As the alien watches John Wayne hug Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man on TV , Elliot hugs a girl he likes . He is then sent to the principal s office . The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches Sesame Street and , at Elliot s urging , dubs itself E.T . He reads a comic strip where Buck Rogers , stranded , calls for help by building a makeshift communication device and is inspired to try it himself . E.T . receives Elliot s help in building a device to phone home by using a Speak & Spell toy . Michael notices that his health is declining and that Elliot is referring to himself as we . On Halloween , Michael and Elliot dress E.T . as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house . Elliot and E.T . ride the former s bike to the forest , where E.T . makes a successful call home . The next morning , Elliot wakes up in the field , only to find E.T . gone , so he returns home to his distressed family . Michael searches for and finds E.T . dying next to a culvert , being investigated by a raccoon . Michael takes him home to Elliot , who is also dying . Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son s illness and the dying E.T. , just as government agents invade the house . Scientists set up a medical facility there , quarantining Elliot and E.T . Their link disappears and E.T . then appears to die while Elliot recovers . A grief-stricken Elliot is left alone with the motionless E.T . when he notices a dead chrysanthemum , the plant E.T . had previously revived , coming back to life . E.T . reanimates and reveals that his people are returning . Elliot and Michael steal a van that E.T . had been loaded into and a chase ensues , with Steve s friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bike . Suddenly facing a police roadblock , they escape as E.T . uses telekinesis to lift them into the air and toward the forest . Standing near the spaceship , E.T . s heart glows as he prepares to return home . Mary , Gertie , and Keys , a government agent , show up . E.T . says goodbye to Michael and Gertie , as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived . Before boarding the spaceship , he tells Elliot I ll be right here , pointing his glowing finger to his forehead . He then picks up the chrysanthemum , boards the spaceship , and it takes off , leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave .

On 6 October 1971 , American soldier Jacob Singer is with the 1st Air Cavalry Division , deployed in a village in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War , when his close-knit unit comes under attack . As many of Jacobs comrades are killed or wounded , others exhibit abnormal behavior , including catatonia and a bloody seizure . A terrified Jacob flees into the jungle , only to be bayoneted in the gut . Jacob awakens in 1975 , on a New York City Subway , with the novel The Stranger . Despite having a PhD , Jacob works as a postal clerk and lives in a rundown apartment in Brooklyn with his seductive girlfriend , Jezzie . Jacob misses his wife and their three sons , especially the youngest , Gabe , who died before the war . He is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences , including inexplicably locked subway exits , faceless vibrating people , a car trying to run him down , a nurse with grotesque teeth on the top of her head , and a bat-like monster penetrating Jezzie at a party , where Jacob collapses with a dangerous fever . The comrade who had gone catatonic , Paul , contacts him to reveal having had similar terrifying experiences , but is immediately killed when his car explodes . Commiserating after the funeral , the platoon-mates confess that all but one have also been living a nightmare . Jacob explains that the army must have done something to them , and they hire a lawyer to investigate . The lawyer backs out after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons . Jacobs comrades also back out , looking scared , as Jacob demands they tell him who got to them . Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who tell him to stop nosing around in military business , but he is able to jump from the moving car . Taken to the hospital , he finds himself strapped to a stretcher being wheeled over bloody body parts , past demented , disfigured inmates . Trapped with doctors wielding barbaric metal instruments , he is told he is already dead , but denies it . He is taken out of the hospital by his friend Louis , who quotes the 14th century Christian mystic Meister Eckhart : Eckhart saw Hell too . He said : The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that wont let go of life , your memories , your attachments . They burn them all away . But theyre not punishing you , he said . Theyre freeing your soul . So , if youre frightened of dying and ... youre holding on , youll see devils tearing your life away . But if youve made your peace , then the devils are really angels , freeing you from the earth. Jacob is approached by a distressed Michael Newman , the man who treated his wound in a medevac helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Pauls burning car . Newman tells a story of having been a chemist with the Armys chemical warfare division in Saigon . He designed the Ladder , a drug that massively increased aggression , taking people straight to their most primal urges . A dose was secretly given to Jacobs unit , who then turned on each other in a homicidal frenzy . At various times Jacob experiences the aftermath of his attack , such as being found gutted in the jungle and being evacuated under fire . At one point he awakens in his home before the war with his wife and all three sons , telling his wife he had a dream he was living with another woman , Jezzie . Eventually he re-experiences the traumatic moment , where it is a fellow American soldier who bayonets him . Finally given knowledge of what happened to him and why , in a calmer place , Jacob returns to his family s apartment . He sorts through his mementos , including his combat dog tags and honorable discharge . He is surprised to see his son Gabe at the foot of the stairwell , who takes him by the hand and leads him up the steps into a bright light . In a wartime triage tent , military doctors declare Jacob dead after putting up quite a fight . He has an expression of peace on his face , implying that he is finally dead .

Eventually he re-experiences the traumatic moment , where it is a fellow American soldier who bayonets him . Finally given knowledge of what happened to him and why , in a calmer place , Jacob returns to his family s apartment .

On 6 October 1971 , American soldier Jacob Singer is with the 1st Air Cavalry Division , deployed in a village in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War , when his close-knit unit comes under attack . As many of Jacobs comrades are killed or wounded , others exhibit abnormal behavior , including catatonia and a bloody seizure . A terrified Jacob flees into the jungle , only to be bayoneted in the gut . Jacob awakens in 1975 , on a New York City Subway , with the novel The Stranger . Despite having a PhD , Jacob works as a postal clerk and lives in a rundown apartment in Brooklyn with his seductive girlfriend , Jezzie . Jacob misses his wife and their three sons , especially the youngest , Gabe , who died before the war . He is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences , including inexplicably locked subway exits , faceless vibrating people , a car trying to run him down , a nurse with grotesque teeth on the top of her head , and a bat-like monster penetrating Jezzie at a party , where Jacob collapses with a dangerous fever . The comrade who had gone catatonic , Paul , contacts him to reveal having had similar terrifying experiences , but is immediately killed when his car explodes . Commiserating after the funeral , the platoon-mates confess that all but one have also been living a nightmare . Jacob explains that the army must have done something to them , and they hire a lawyer to investigate . The lawyer backs out after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons . Jacobs comrades also back out , looking scared , as Jacob demands they tell him who got to them . Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who tell him to stop nosing around in military business , but he is able to jump from the moving car . Taken to the hospital , he finds himself strapped to a stretcher being wheeled over bloody body parts , past demented , disfigured inmates . Trapped with doctors wielding barbaric metal instruments , he is told he is already dead , but denies it . He is taken out of the hospital by his friend Louis , who quotes the 14th century Christian mystic Meister Eckhart : Eckhart saw Hell too . He said : The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that wont let go of life , your memories , your attachments . They burn them all away . But theyre not punishing you , he said . Theyre freeing your soul . So , if youre frightened of dying and ... youre holding on , youll see devils tearing your life away . But if youve made your peace , then the devils are really angels , freeing you from the earth. Jacob is approached by a distressed Michael Newman , the man who treated his wound in a medevac helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Pauls burning car . Newman tells a story of having been a chemist with the Armys chemical warfare division in Saigon . He designed the Ladder , a drug that massively increased aggression , taking people straight to their most primal urges . A dose was secretly given to Jacobs unit , who then turned on each other in a homicidal frenzy .

On 6 October 1971 , American soldier Jacob Singer is with the 1st Air Cavalry Division , deployed in a village in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War , when his close-knit unit comes under attack . As many of Jacobs comrades are killed or wounded , others exhibit abnormal behavior , including catatonia and a bloody seizure . A terrified Jacob flees into the jungle , only to be bayoneted in the gut . Jacob awakens in 1975 , on a New York City Subway , with the novel The Stranger . Despite having a PhD , Jacob works as a postal clerk and lives in a rundown apartment in Brooklyn with his seductive girlfriend , Jezzie . Jacob misses his wife and their three sons , especially the youngest , Gabe , who died before the war . He is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences , including inexplicably locked subway exits , faceless vibrating people , a car trying to run him down , a nurse with grotesque teeth on the top of her head , and a bat-like monster penetrating Jezzie at a party , where Jacob collapses with a dangerous fever . The comrade who had gone catatonic , Paul , contacts him to reveal having had similar terrifying experiences , but is immediately killed when his car explodes . Commiserating after the funeral , the platoon-mates confess that all but one have also been living a nightmare . Jacob explains that the army must have done something to them , and they hire a lawyer to investigate . The lawyer backs out after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons . Jacobs comrades also back out , looking scared , as Jacob demands they tell him who got to them . Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who tell him to stop nosing around in military business , but he is able to jump from the moving car . Taken to the hospital , he finds himself strapped to a stretcher being wheeled over bloody body parts , past demented , disfigured inmates . Trapped with doctors wielding barbaric metal instruments , he is told he is already dead , but denies it . He is taken out of the hospital by his friend Louis , who quotes the 14th century Christian mystic Meister Eckhart : Eckhart saw Hell too . He said : The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that wont let go of life , your memories , your attachments . They burn them all away . But theyre not punishing you , he said . Theyre freeing your soul . So , if youre frightened of dying and ... youre holding on , youll see devils tearing your life away . But if youve made your peace , then the devils are really angels , freeing you from the earth. Jacob is approached by a distressed Michael Newman , the man who treated his wound in a medevac helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Pauls burning car . Newman tells a story of having been a chemist with the Armys chemical warfare division in Saigon . He designed the Ladder , a drug that massively increased aggression , taking people straight to their most primal urges . A dose was secretly given to Jacobs unit , who then turned on each other in a homicidal frenzy . At various times Jacob experiences the aftermath of his attack , such as being found gutted in the jungle and being evacuated under fire . At one point he awakens in his home before the war with his wife and all three sons , telling his wife he had a dream he was living with another woman , Jezzie . Eventually he re-experiences the traumatic moment , where it is a fellow American soldier who bayonets him . Finally given knowledge of what happened to him and why , in a calmer place , Jacob returns to his family s apartment . He sorts through his mementos , including his combat dog tags and honorable discharge . He is surprised to see his son Gabe at the foot of the stairwell , who takes him by the hand and leads him up the steps into a bright light . In a wartime triage tent , military doctors declare Jacob dead after putting up quite a fight . He has an expression of peace on his face , implying that he is finally dead .


Nicky Rogan has written several plays and has achieved success . It is now opening night of his latest effort , and all around him assure him that this one will be the best yet . But as opening hour approaches , Rogan falls prey to doubts and fears , egged on by another playwright whose last work was trashed by the local newspaper s new drama critic , Steven Schwimmer . He eventually lets those fears drive him to adopt a resolve to kill the critic ( who he assumes will also trash his play ) , and he procures a handgun with which to perform the deed . Instead of attending the play s opening night Rogan spends the time in a bar , accompanied by a lady cab driver and her grandson ; earlier in the evening the lady misidentified Rogan as a local small-time hoodlum , and Rogan does not correct her misidentification . They watch the most crucial Game 6 of the World Series playoff between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets . The Sox had won 3 games and could clinch the title by winning Game 6 , but Rogan , a lifelong Sox fan , knows how easily they can lose when they should win . He spends the evening waiting for the inevitable , even though the Sox are ahead most of the time . When the inevitable does occur ( due to an unexpected pair of errors at the end of the final inning ) , he snaps , and heads out to take out his rage on the newspaper critic . He not only finds the critic , but finds him in the early stages of deflowering the playwright s daughter . He begins firing wildly , but is finally calmed when he learns that the critic is equally devastated by the Sox s loss . They end up together , watching an interminable rerun of the final error on a small television set in the critic s apartment .

As an infant , Innocent was dumped at the farm during a violent storm , by a stranger who explained he had to keep going but feared endangering the child . He promised to return , but never did , instead sending money every six months . Jocelyn reveals this in a deathbed confession . After his death , Innocent receives a visit from her birth mother , Lady Blythe . A shallow and pretentious noblewoman , she explains that Innocent was the result of a fling she d had with artist Pierce Armitage . He was probably the one who left her at the farm . Innocent departs for London , planning to earn her living by writing and make a name for herself , since she has none by birthright . She has one book already written ; it s wildly successful , and she writes another . In the usual Corellian coincidences , Innocent s landlady had had a serious relationship with Pierce Armitage , and Lord Blythe had been his friend at school . Lady Blythe confesses all , then dies . In Italy , Lord Blythe discovers Armitage alive and tells him of Innocent ; Armitage at once prepares to claim his daughter legally .

Ex-fighter pilot and taxi driver Ted Striker ( Robert Hays ) became traumatized during an unnamed war , leading to a pathological fear of flying . As a result , he is unable to hold a responsible job . His wartime girlfriend , Elaine Dickinson ( Julie Hagerty ) , now a flight attendant , leaves him . Striker nervously boards a Boeing 707 ( Trans American Flight 209 ) from Los Angeles to Chicago on which she is serving , hoping to win her back , but she rebuffs him . After dinner is served , many of the passengers fall ill , and fellow passenger Dr. Rumack ( Leslie Nielsen ) deduces that the passengers have contracted food poisoning from the fish . The cockpit crew , including pilot Clarence Oveur ( Peter Graves ) and co-pilot Roger Murdock ( Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ) , have also been affected , leaving no one to fly the plane . Elaine contacts the Chicago control tower for help , and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey ( Lloyd Bridges ) to activate the plane s autopilot , a large inflatable pilot doll ( listed as Otto in the end credits ) , which will get them to Chicago , but will not be able to land the plane . Rumack convinces Striker to fly the plane , though Striker feels unable to handle the pressure and the unfamiliar aircraft . McCroskey knows that he must get someone else to help take the plane down and calls Rex Kramer ( Robert Stack ) , Striker s commanding officer in the war . Despite their hostile relationship , he is the best choice to instruct Striker . As the plane nears Chicago , Striker is overcome by stress and manages to land the plane only after a pep talk from Dr. Rumack . With Kramer s advice , Striker is able to land the plane safely with only minor injuries to some passengers . Striker s courage rekindles Elaine s love for him , and the two share a kiss . Otto takes off in the evacuated plane after inflating a female companion .

The novel opens with the introduction of its title characters . The heroine is the superb Virginia St. John , a celebrated beauty , famous for being famous . At the age of thirty she is the newlywed wife of an English bishop . The hero ( the term has to be applied satirically ) is Prof. Paul Darnley , a prominent intellectual : He had written three volumes on the origin of life , which he had spent seven years in looking for in hay and cheese ; he had written five volumes on the entozoa of the pig , and two volumes of lectures , as a corollary to these , on the sublimity of human heroism and the whole duty of man . He was renowned all over Europe and America as a complete embodiment of enlightened modern thinking . He criticised everything ; he took nothing on trust , except the unspeakable sublimity of the human race and its august terrestrial destinies . Both characters are traveling abroad the steamship Australasian , sailing from Melbourne to London ; Virginia is on her way to Chausible Island to meet her new husband , while Paul is journeying home to his elderly wife , whom he has been avoiding for the past eighteen months . ( Mrs. Prof. Darnley has an irrational determination to convince her atheist and materialist husband of the existence of Hell . ) On the voyage , Paul lectures on his value system , which is essentially Comte s Religion of Humanity , and manages to convince many passengers and crew of the truth of his outlook ( though Virginia does not listen to him ) . An approaching storm inspires the crew to load the ship s cutter with survival supplies , including tinned meats and cases of champagne . The storm passes , but the ship s boiler suddenly explodes ; the Australasian quickly sinks with the loss of almost all on board . Yet Paul and Virginia manage to reach a nearby island in the cutter . ( Shipwreck on a deserted island , as a start for a new and better society , is a staple in the utopian genre  as in the Spensonia books of Thomas Spence , among other possible examples . ) Paul finds a deserted house built from wreckage ; it is a comfortable and neatly furnished cottage , and the two survivors move in . Virginia is deeply distraught over their recent tragedy  but her state of mind improves when she realizes that the largest trunk in her luggage is on the cutter . The tinned meats and champagne also come in handy . Two other survivors appear : an English clergyman who has been converted to Positivism by Paul , and an elderly woman . The latter soon dies , giving Paul and the clergyman opportunity to debate the meaning of her death from the Positivist viewpoint . Paul keeps himself busy searching for the missing link . Liberated from the trammels of traditional culture and belief , Paul confidently expects instant attainment of the sublime happiness that is the natural state of free human beings . The clergyman proves to be an inconvenient convert , however ; he spends his time getting drunk and trying to kiss Virginia , and Paul s intellectual arguments have little influence on him . Physical intimidation is more effective , since the clergyman is both a coward and a weakling . When the drunken clergyman falls off a cliff , Paul meditates on the utilitarian aspects of his death . Paul eventually converts Virginia ; she gives up her religious faith , and replaces it with a sexual desire for Paul  which the intellectual Paul finds very uncomfortable . In her new commitment to glorious truth , Virginia snoops through all of Paul s private papers , and discovers his secret : he himself was once a clergyman . By the final chapter of the story , Paul is reduced to baying at the moon . His howls attract the notice of another couple . The woman turns out to be Paul s wife , who has come searching for her errant husband . And the man is Virginia s husband the Bishop . It happens that the island on which Paul and Virginia landed is none other than Chausible Island , her destination , and the cottage they ve been occupying was prepared by the Bishop for Virginia . At the end of the book , Paul discovers that his wife has attained her goal , and that he now believes in Hell .

The woman turns out to be Paul s wife , who has come searching for her errant husband . And the man is Virginia s husband the Bishop . It happens that the island on which Paul and Virginia landed is none other than Chausible Island , her destination , and the cottage they ve been occupying was prepared by the Bishop for Virginia . At the end of the book , Paul discovers that his wife has attained her goal , and that he now believes in Hell .


The novel opens with the introduction of its title characters . The heroine is the superb Virginia St. John , a celebrated beauty , famous for being famous . At the age of thirty she is the newlywed wife of an English bishop . The hero ( the term has to be applied satirically ) is Prof. Paul Darnley , a prominent intellectual : He had written three volumes on the origin of life , which he had spent seven years in looking for in hay and cheese ; he had written five volumes on the entozoa of the pig , and two volumes of lectures , as a corollary to these , on the sublimity of human heroism and the whole duty of man . He was renowned all over Europe and America as a complete embodiment of enlightened modern thinking . He criticised everything ; he took nothing on trust , except the unspeakable sublimity of the human race and its august terrestrial destinies . Both characters are traveling abroad the steamship Australasian , sailing from Melbourne to London ; Virginia is on her way to Chausible Island to meet her new husband , while Paul is journeying home to his elderly wife , whom he has been avoiding for the past eighteen months . ( Mrs. Prof. Darnley has an irrational determination to convince her atheist and materialist husband of the existence of Hell . ) On the voyage , Paul lectures on his value system , which is essentially Comte s Religion of Humanity , and manages to convince many passengers and crew of the truth of his outlook ( though Virginia does not listen to him ) . An approaching storm inspires the crew to load the ship s cutter with survival supplies , including tinned meats and cases of champagne . The storm passes , but the ship s boiler suddenly explodes ; the Australasian quickly sinks with the loss of almost all on board . Yet Paul and Virginia manage to reach a nearby island in the cutter . ( Shipwreck on a deserted island , as a start for a new and better society , is a staple in the utopian genre  as in the Spensonia books of Thomas Spence , among other possible examples . ) Paul finds a deserted house built from wreckage ; it is a comfortable and neatly furnished cottage , and the two survivors move in . Virginia is deeply distraught over their recent tragedy  but her state of mind improves when she realizes that the largest trunk in her luggage is on the cutter . The tinned meats and champagne also come in handy . Two other survivors appear : an English clergyman who has been converted to Positivism by Paul , and an elderly woman . The latter soon dies , giving Paul and the clergyman opportunity to debate the meaning of her death from the Positivist viewpoint . Paul keeps himself busy searching for the missing link . Liberated from the trammels of traditional culture and belief , Paul confidently expects instant attainment of the sublime happiness that is the natural state of free human beings . The clergyman proves to be an inconvenient convert , however ; he spends his time getting drunk and trying to kiss Virginia , and Paul s intellectual arguments have little influence on him . Physical intimidation is more effective , since the clergyman is both a coward and a weakling . When the drunken clergyman falls off a cliff , Paul meditates on the utilitarian aspects of his death . Paul eventually converts Virginia ; she gives up her religious faith , and replaces it with a sexual desire for Paul  which the intellectual Paul finds very uncomfortable .

In 1910 , the last year of Leo Tolstoy s life , his disciples , led by Vladimir Chertkov , manoeuvre against his wife , Sofya , for control over Tolstoy s works after his death . The main setting is the Tolstoy country estate of Yasnaya Polyana . Tolstoy and Sofya have had a long , passionate marriage , but his spiritual ideals and asceticism ( he is opposed , for example , to private property ) are at odds with her more aristocratic and conventionally religious views . Contention focuses on a new will that the Tolstoians are attempting to persuade him to sign . It would place all of his copyrights into the public domain , supposedly leaving his family without adequate support . The maneuvering is seen through the eyes of Tolstoy s new secretary , Valentin Bulgakov , who finds himself mediating between the two sides . He also has a love affair with one of the Tolstoians , Masha . Ultimately , Tolstoy signs the new will and travels to an undisclosed location where he can continue his work undisturbed . After his departure , Sofya unsuccessfully attempts suicide . During the journey , Tolstoy falls ill . The film ends with his death near the Astapovo train station where Sofya is allowed by their daughter to see him just moments before his death . The closing credits state that five years after his death the Russian senate reverted the copyrights of Tolstoy s work to Sofya .

Bateman breaks off his engagement with Evelyn . That night , as he uses an ATM , he finds a stray kitten ; the ATM displays the text feed me a stray cat . As he prepares to shoot the cat , a woman sees him and tries to stop him ; he shoots her and lets the cat go free . A police chase ensues , but Bateman destroys the police cars by shooting their gas tanks . Fleeing to his office , Bateman enters the wrong office building , where he murders a security guard and a janitor . In his office , Bateman calls his lawyer Harold and frantically leaves a lengthy confession on Harold s answering machine . The following morning , Bateman visits Paul s apartment , expecting it to be full of decomposing bodies and in the middle of a police investigation , but it is vacant and for sale . The real estate broker tells him to leave . As Bateman goes to meet with his colleagues and lawyer for lunch , Jean finds detailed drawings of murder , mutilation , and rape in Bateman s office journal to her disgust and sympathy . Bateman sees Harold at a restaurant and tries to convince him that he is a serial killer relating to the phone message he left the other night . Harold mistakes Patrick for another colleague and laughs off the phone message confession as a joke , saying he had dinner with Paul in London days earlier . A confused Bateman returns to his friends and in a final voice-over narration , he realizes he will continue to escape the punishment he deserves , that there has been no catharsis , and that his confession has meant nothing .

All of the stories within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told in a first-person narrative from the point of view of Dr. Watson , as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories . The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes tend to point out social injustices , such as a king s betrayal of an opera singer , a stepfather s deception of his ward as a fictitious lover , an aristocratic crook s exploitation of a failing pawnbroker , a beggar s extensive estate in Kent . It suggests that , in contrast , Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of official incompetence and aristocratic privilege . The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes contains many of Doyle s favourite Sherlock Holmes stories . In 1927 , he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories to The Strand Magazine . Among those he listed were The Adventure of the Speckled Band ( as his favourite ) , The Red-Headed League ( second ) , A Scandal in Bohemia ( fifth ) and The Five Orange Pips ( seventh ) . The book was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 because of its alleged occultism , but the book gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books , and the restriction was lifted in 1940 .

Anna Khitrova , a British-Russian midwife at a London hospital , finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana , a 14-year-old girl who dies in childbirth . She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian Restaurant , which is owned by Semyon , an old vor in the Russian Mafia . Anna thus sets out to track down the girl s family so that she can find a home for the baby girl , having meetings with Semyon , whom she initially regards as friendly . Anna s mother Helen does not discourage her , but Anna s Russian uncle and self-described former KGB officer , Stepan , whom Anna asks for help with the translation of the diary , urges caution . Through translation of the diary , Anna comes to learn that Semyon and his ignorant , unstable son Kirill had abused the girl , addicted her to heroin , forced her into prostitution , and raped her . Ultimately , Anna realizes that the baby was fathered by Semyon ( in several scenes it is made clear that Kirill is impotent and never had sex with Tatiana ) . Kirill s driver is Nikolai Luzhin , who also serves as the family cleaner , dumping murdered bodies in the River Thames . Through Nikolai , Semyon , fearing prosecution , promises to give the location of the girl s family to Anna if she hands back the diary . Nikolai takes the diary but does not give a location , instead urging Anna to keep the baby in London . Semyon distrusts Anna s uncle Stepan and orders Nikolai to kill him . Nikolai accepts and soon Stepan goes missing . As Nikolai s star rises within the vory , an impressed Semyon sponsors him as a full member , due in part to Nikolai s protection of Semyon s incompetent son , who authorized a hit on a rival Chechen vory leader with the help of a Kurdish associate , Azim . The hit was ill-advised and not approved by Semyon . Two Chechen hitmen soon arrive in London seeking vengeance and kill Azim s mentally handicapped nephew who also took part in the hit . Semyon hatches a plan to trick Nikolai into temporarily taking Kirill s place during a meeting at the baths with Azim . The Chechens attack , thinking Nikolai is Kirill , but Nikolai kills them both , ending up in the hospital with severe wounds . It is revealed that Nikolai is actually an FSB agent who has infiltrated the gang , working under license by the British Government and a senior police officer . As part of his undercover duties , Nikolai was able to read Tatiana s diary before Semyon destroyed it and hatched a plan to have Semyon arrested for statutory rape , with a paternity test of Tatiana s baby as evidence . Stepan is also safe , hiding in a 5-star hotel in Edinburgh for protection . Semyon orders Kirill to kidnap the baby girl and kill her . But as Kirill sits by the Thames working up the courage to throw the child in , Nikolai and Anna find him and persuade him to give the baby back . Nikolai and Kirill embrace as Nikolai tells him that his father is finished and they are now the bosses . Nikolai and Anna kiss and part for the last time . Nikolai succeeds Semyon as boss of the organization and Anna gains custody of Tatiana s baby , whom she names Christine .

Anna Khitrova , a British-Russian midwife at a London hospital , finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana , a 14-year-old girl who dies in childbirth . She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian Restaurant , which is owned by Semyon , an old vor in the Russian Mafia . Anna thus sets out to track down the girl s family so that she can find a home for the baby girl , having meetings with Semyon , whom she initially regards as friendly . Anna s mother Helen does not discourage her , but Anna s Russian uncle and self-described former KGB officer , Stepan , whom Anna asks for help with the translation of the diary , urges caution . Through translation of the diary , Anna comes to learn that Semyon and his ignorant , unstable son Kirill had abused the girl , addicted her to heroin , forced her into prostitution , and raped her . Ultimately , Anna realizes that the baby was fathered by Semyon ( in several scenes it is made clear that Kirill is impotent and never had sex with Tatiana ) . Kirill s driver is Nikolai Luzhin , who also serves as the family cleaner , dumping murdered bodies in the River Thames . Through Nikolai , Semyon , fearing prosecution , promises to give the location of the girl s family to Anna if she hands back the diary . Nikolai takes the diary but does not give a location , instead urging Anna to keep the baby in London . Semyon distrusts Anna s uncle Stepan and orders Nikolai to kill him . Nikolai accepts and soon Stepan goes missing . As Nikolai s star rises within the vory , an impressed Semyon sponsors him as a full member , due in part to Nikolai s protection of Semyon s incompetent son , who authorized a hit on a rival Chechen vory leader with the help of a Kurdish associate , Azim . The hit was ill-advised and not approved by Semyon . Two Chechen hitmen soon arrive in London seeking vengeance and kill Azim s mentally handicapped nephew who also took part in the hit . Semyon hatches a plan to trick Nikolai into temporarily taking Kirill s place during a meeting at the baths with Azim . The Chechens attack , thinking Nikolai is Kirill , but Nikolai kills them both , ending up in the hospital with severe wounds . It is revealed that Nikolai is actually an FSB agent who has infiltrated the gang , working under license by the British Government and a senior police officer . As part of his undercover duties , Nikolai was able to read Tatiana s diary before Semyon destroyed it and hatched a plan to have Semyon arrested for statutory rape , with a paternity test of Tatiana s baby as evidence . Stepan is also safe , hiding in a 5-star hotel in Edinburgh for protection . Semyon orders Kirill to kidnap the baby girl and kill her .

The book centers around the life of Otto , the son of German warlord Baron Conrad . Otto s mother , Baroness Matilda , has died in premature labour , brought on by the sight of the Baron s battle wounds , prompting Conrad to take his newborn son to be raised in a nearby monastery . When Otto reaches the age of eleven his father returns to claim him from the gentle monks , taking him back to live in Castle Drachenhausen , ( Dragons ' House , in German ) the ancestral mountaintop fortress from which the Baron launches his attacks . Here Otto learns of and is horrified by his father s life as a robber baron , and particularly the revelation of how Conrad killed a defeated , surrendering enemy , Baron Frederick , a rival robber baron who with his men was defending a column of merchants in return for the tribute they were paying him . Shortly thereafter Baron Conrad obeys a summons to the Imperial Court , taking the vast majority of his men-at-arms with him as an impressive escort but leaving Castle Drachenhausen practically undefended as a result . The late Baron Frederick s heir , his nephew Baron Henry , then attacks the castle , burning it to the ground , and taking Otto captive to his own fortress , Castle Trutzdrachen ( Dragon-scorner , in German ) . In the dungeon of his castle , Baron Henry explains to Otto that he has sworn a solemn oath that any member of Baron Conrad s House who fell into his hands would never be able to strike a blow like the one which killed his uncle , Baron Frederick . Because Otto is so young , the Baron keeps this oath by cutting off his right hand instead of killing him , and as an afterthought has a healer sent to tend to him . While Otto is feverish from the pain of his wound , he is comforted by Baron Henry s eight-year-old daughter , Pauline , who visits his cell . Otto s father Baron Conrad then returns and rescues him with the help of a few remaining loyal followers . Baron Henry and his men give chase and Otto s father kills Baron Henry in single combat but dies in the process , choosing to sacrifice his life so that his son can escape . Otto flees to the monastery where he grew up , and is given refuge there . After Otto regains his health the Abbot accompanies him to an audience with the Emperor , who promises restitution and takes responsibility for Otto s future upbringing . Otto becomes a respected statesman , marries his former captor s daughter Pauline , and is known for his wise counsel and peaceful nature , his amputated swordhand being replaced by an artificial and immobile one made of silver . The Emperor has Castle Drachenhausen rebuilt for the couple , and over the gatehouse is carved the motto Manus Argentea Quam Manus Ferrea Melior Est , which translated from Latin means A hand of silver is better than a hand of iron .

The Emperor has Castle Drachenhausen rebuilt for the couple , and over the gatehouse is carved the motto Manus Argentea Quam Manus Ferrea Melior Est , which translated from Latin means A hand of silver is better than a hand of iron .


The book centers around the life of Otto , the son of German warlord Baron Conrad . Otto s mother , Baroness Matilda , has died in premature labour , brought on by the sight of the Baron s battle wounds , prompting Conrad to take his newborn son to be raised in a nearby monastery . When Otto reaches the age of eleven his father returns to claim him from the gentle monks , taking him back to live in Castle Drachenhausen , ( Dragons ' House , in German ) the ancestral mountaintop fortress from which the Baron launches his attacks . Here Otto learns of and is horrified by his father s life as a robber baron , and particularly the revelation of how Conrad killed a defeated , surrendering enemy , Baron Frederick , a rival robber baron who with his men was defending a column of merchants in return for the tribute they were paying him . Shortly thereafter Baron Conrad obeys a summons to the Imperial Court , taking the vast majority of his men-at-arms with him as an impressive escort but leaving Castle Drachenhausen practically undefended as a result . The late Baron Frederick s heir , his nephew Baron Henry , then attacks the castle , burning it to the ground , and taking Otto captive to his own fortress , Castle Trutzdrachen ( Dragon-scorner , in German ) . In the dungeon of his castle , Baron Henry explains to Otto that he has sworn a solemn oath that any member of Baron Conrad s House who fell into his hands would never be able to strike a blow like the one which killed his uncle , Baron Frederick . Because Otto is so young , the Baron keeps this oath by cutting off his right hand instead of killing him , and as an afterthought has a healer sent to tend to him . While Otto is feverish from the pain of his wound , he is comforted by Baron Henry s eight-year-old daughter , Pauline , who visits his cell . Otto s father Baron Conrad then returns and rescues him with the help of a few remaining loyal followers . Baron Henry and his men give chase and Otto s father kills Baron Henry in single combat but dies in the process , choosing to sacrifice his life so that his son can escape . Otto flees to the monastery where he grew up , and is given refuge there .

In 1945 , at his daughter Connie s wedding , Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather , the Don of a New York crime family . Vito s youngest son , Michael , who was a Marine during World War II , introduces his girlfriend , Kay Adams , to his family at the reception . Johnny Fontane , a famous singer and godson to Vito , seeks Vito s help in securing a movie role ; Vito dispatches his consigliere , Tom Hagen , to Los Angeles to talk the obnoxious studio head , Jack Woltz , into giving Johnny the part . Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion . Shortly before Christmas , drug baron Virgil The Turk Sollozzo , backed by the Tattaglia crime family , asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections . Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders , Vito declines . Suspicious , Vito sends his enforcer , Luca Brasi , to spy on them . Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street , then kidnaps Hagen . With Corleone first-born Sonny in command , Hagen is pressured to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo s deal , then released . The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi s bullet-proof vest , indicating that Luca sleeps with the fishes . Vito survives , and at the hospital Michael thwarts another attempt on his father ; Michael s jaw is broken by NYPD Captain Marc McCluskey , Sollozzo s bodyguard . Sonny retaliates with a hit on Tattaglia s son . Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey : on the pretext of settling the dispute , Michael agrees to meet them in a Bronx restaurant . There , retrieving a planted handgun , he kills both men . Despite a clampdown by the authorities , the Five Families erupt in open warfare and Vito s sons fear for their safety . Michael takes refuge in Sicily , and his brother , Fredo , is sheltered by the Corleone s Las Vegas casino partner , Moe Greene . Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister and threatens to kill him if it happens again . When it does , Sonny speeds to their home , but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and riddled with submachine gun fire . While in Sicily , Michael meets and marries Apollonia Vitelli , but a car bomb intended for him takes her life . Devastated by Sonny s death , Vito moves to end the feuds . Realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don Emilio Barzini , Vito assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging his son s murder . His safety guaranteed , Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay , who gives birth to two children by the early 1950s . With his father at the end of his career and his brother too weak , Michael takes the family reins , promising his wife the business will be legitimate within five years . To that end , he insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a wartime consigliere ; Vito agrees Tom should have no part in what will happen in the coming battles with rival families . When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene s stake in the family s casinos , their partner derides the Corleones for being run out of New York ; Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene s sway . Vito suffers a fatal heart attack . At the funeral , Tessio , a Corleone capo , asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini , signalling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned . The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connies baby . While Michael stands at the altar as the child s godfather , Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene . Tessio is executed for his treachery ; Michael extracts Carlos confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny s murder for Barzini . After Clemenza , a Corleone capo , garrotes Carlo with a wire , Connie accuses Michael of the murder , telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings . Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it , but when the capos arrive , they address her husband as Don Corleone . She watches fearfully as they close the door on her .

Realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don Emilio Barzini , Vito assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging his son s murder . His safety guaranteed , Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay , who gives birth to two children by the early 1950s . With his father at the end of his career and his brother too weak , Michael takes the family reins , promising his wife the business will be legitimate within five years . To that end , he insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a wartime consigliere ; Vito agrees Tom should have no part in what will happen in the coming battles with rival families . When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene s stake in the family s casinos , their partner derides the Corleones for being run out of New York ; Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene s sway . Vito suffers a fatal heart attack . At the funeral , Tessio , a Corleone capo , asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini , signalling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned . The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connies baby . While Michael stands at the altar as the child s godfather , Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene . Tessio is executed for his treachery ; Michael extracts Carlos confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny s murder for Barzini . After Clemenza , a Corleone capo , garrotes Carlo with a wire , Connie accuses Michael of the murder , telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings . Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it , but when the capos arrive , they address her husband as Don Corleone . She watches fearfully as they close the door on her .


In 1945 , at his daughter Connie s wedding , Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather , the Don of a New York crime family . Vito s youngest son , Michael , who was a Marine during World War II , introduces his girlfriend , Kay Adams , to his family at the reception . Johnny Fontane , a famous singer and godson to Vito , seeks Vito s help in securing a movie role ; Vito dispatches his consigliere , Tom Hagen , to Los Angeles to talk the obnoxious studio head , Jack Woltz , into giving Johnny the part . Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion . Shortly before Christmas , drug baron Virgil The Turk Sollozzo , backed by the Tattaglia crime family , asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections . Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders , Vito declines . Suspicious , Vito sends his enforcer , Luca Brasi , to spy on them . Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street , then kidnaps Hagen . With Corleone first-born Sonny in command , Hagen is pressured to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo s deal , then released . The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi s bullet-proof vest , indicating that Luca sleeps with the fishes . Vito survives , and at the hospital Michael thwarts another attempt on his father ; Michael s jaw is broken by NYPD Captain Marc McCluskey , Sollozzo s bodyguard . Sonny retaliates with a hit on Tattaglia s son . Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey : on the pretext of settling the dispute , Michael agrees to meet them in a Bronx restaurant . There , retrieving a planted handgun , he kills both men . Despite a clampdown by the authorities , the Five Families erupt in open warfare and Vito s sons fear for their safety . Michael takes refuge in Sicily , and his brother , Fredo , is sheltered by the Corleone s Las Vegas casino partner , Moe Greene . Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister and threatens to kill him if it happens again .

Writing as a narrator describing events from his own past , Beerbohm presents himself as a moderately successful young English essayist and writer during the 1890s . He then purports to relate the tragic history of a friend and colleague of his named Enoch Soames . Soames is a contemporary of the younger Beerbohm ; a fellow-Englishman of secure but moderate means , living off an inherited annuity , and an utterly obscure , forgettable , miserable , and unknown aspiring poet . Over the course of the story , he is the author and publisher of a succession of unsuccessful books of poems . His appearance is described as dim and leaving little impression , except for his persistent habit of always wearing a particular grey waterproof cape and soft black hat . On the afternoon of 3 June 1897 , Soames and Beerbohm are having lunch in the Soho-based Restaurant du Vingtieme Siecle . Soames is self-obsessed and deeply depressed ; consumed with the belief that he is an unrecognised great author of literature and poetry , unhappy about his current obscurity and failure , and keenly curious about his certain fate of posthumous fame . Despairing and desperate for assurance of the eventual recognition of his works and talent , Soames agrees to a contract offered by the Devil , who introduces himself from a neighbouring table . In exchange for the future possession of his soul , Soames will be transported exactly 100 years forward in time ; to spend one afternoon ( from 2:10 PM to 7 PM ) in the Reading Room of the British Museum , a world-renowned centre for bibliographic research , to discover what judgement posterity will make on himself and his works . After the allotted time has expired , Soames will be returned to their present date and location , but at the same time of evening as his departure from the future ; and the Devil will then collect his payment . After the agreement is made , Soames vanishes ; then reappears in the caf at the designated hour , where Beerbohm has returned to meet him . Soames description of the world of future is , like himself , vague and nondescript ; while there he had focussed primarily on his own concerns . He tells Beerbohm that the only mention he could find of himself was in a single scholarly article , of which Soames produces a facsimile-copy . It is printed in English , but in a phonetic spelling and with modified pronunciation ; both of which had apparently evolved during the intervening century . The article discusses a fictional story written by one Max Beerbohm in wich e pautraid an immajnari karrakter kauld Enoch Soames a thurd-rait poit hoo beleevz imself a grate jeneus an maix a bargin with th Devvl in auder ter no wot posterriti thinx ov im ! ( in which he portrayed an imaginary character called Enoch Soames a third-rate poet who believes himself a great genius and makes a bargain with the Devil to know what posterity thinks of him ! ) . With characteristic delicacy , Beerbohm quotes the author as saying It is a somewhat labud sattire and adds And labud'what on earth was that ? ( To this day I have never made out that word . ) ( labud here means laboured ) . Beerbohm , shocked , denies that he would ever write such a thing . While the two are debating this point , the Devil returns . Before being taken to Hell , Soames scornfully requests that Beerbohm at least try to make people believe that he , Soames , actually existed . Beerbohm concludes his narrative by calling down the author of the scholarly article in question for shoddy work ; he notes that T.K Nupton must not have finished reading Beerbohm s story , otherwise he would have noticed Soames s ( through Beerbohm ) flawless predictions about the future and realised the story was not fiction . Beerbohm then notes Soames had mentioned that his presence in the reading room caused a great stir , and writes I assure you that in no period could Soames be anything but dim . The fact that people are going to stare at him , and follow him around , and seem afraid of him , can be explained only on the hypothesis that they will somehow have been prepared for his ghostly visitation . They will have been awfully waiting to see whether he really would come . And when he does come , the effect will of course be  awful .

Soames is a contemporary of the younger Beerbohm ; a fellow-Englishman of secure but moderate means , living off an inherited annuity , and an utterly obscure , forgettable , miserable , and unknown aspiring poet . Over the course of the story , he is the author and publisher of a succession of unsuccessful books of poems . His appearance is described as dim and leaving little impression , except for his persistent habit of always wearing a particular grey waterproof cape and soft black hat . On the afternoon of 3 June 1897 , Soames and Beerbohm are having lunch in the Soho-based Restaurant du Vingtieme Siecle . Soames is self-obsessed and deeply depressed ; consumed with the belief that he is an unrecognised great author of literature and poetry , unhappy about his current obscurity and failure , and keenly curious about his certain fate of posthumous fame . Despairing and desperate for assurance of the eventual recognition of his works and talent , Soames agrees to a contract offered by the Devil , who introduces himself from a neighbouring table . In exchange for the future possession of his soul , Soames will be transported exactly 100 years forward in time ; to spend one afternoon ( from 2:10 PM to 7 PM ) in the Reading Room of the British Museum , a world-renowned centre for bibliographic research , to discover what judgement posterity will make on himself and his works . After the allotted time has expired , Soames will be returned to their present date and location , but at the same time of evening as his departure from the future ; and the Devil will then collect his payment . After the agreement is made , Soames vanishes ; then reappears in the caf at the designated hour , where Beerbohm has returned to meet him . Soames description of the world of future is , like himself , vague and nondescript ; while there he had focussed primarily on his own concerns . He tells Beerbohm that the only mention he could find of himself was in a single scholarly article , of which Soames produces a facsimile-copy . It is printed in English , but in a phonetic spelling and with modified pronunciation ; both of which had apparently evolved during the intervening century . The article discusses a fictional story written by one Max Beerbohm in wich e pautraid an immajnari karrakter kauld Enoch Soames a thurd-rait poit hoo beleevz imself a grate jeneus an maix a bargin with th Devvl in auder ter no wot posterriti thinx ov im ! ( in which he portrayed an imaginary character called Enoch Soames a third-rate poet who believes himself a great genius and makes a bargain with the Devil to know what posterity thinks of him ! ) . With characteristic delicacy , Beerbohm quotes the author as saying It is a somewhat labud sattire and adds And labud'what on earth was that ? ( To this day I have never made out that word . ) ( labud here means laboured ) . Beerbohm , shocked , denies that he would ever write such a thing . While the two are debating this point , the Devil returns . Before being taken to Hell , Soames scornfully requests that Beerbohm at least try to make people believe that he , Soames , actually existed . Beerbohm concludes his narrative by calling down the author of the scholarly article in question for shoddy work ; he notes that T.K Nupton must not have finished reading Beerbohm s story , otherwise he would have noticed Soames s ( through Beerbohm ) flawless predictions about the future and realised the story was not fiction . Beerbohm then notes Soames had mentioned that his presence in the reading room caused a great stir , and writes I assure you that in no period could Soames be anything but dim . The fact that people are going to stare at him , and follow him around , and seem afraid of him , can be explained only on the hypothesis that they will somehow have been prepared for his ghostly visitation . They will have been awfully waiting to see whether he really would come . And when he does come , the effect will of course be  awful .


The beautiful young Theodora Fitzgerald belongs to a family of noble lineage whose fortunes have waned and who have lived in near poverty for most of her life . The book begins with her arranged marriage to Josiah Brown , a nouveau-riche Australian in his fifties . The marriage was contracted for convenience : Josiah simply wants a pretty and aristocratic wife to improve his standing in society , and the Fitzgerald family are in need of Brown s financial resources . Theodora only agrees to the marriage for the sake of her father and sisters . Immediately after the wedding , Josiah falls ill. Theodora proves a dutiful and capable wife , and attends to her husband s every need , though she is secretly very unhappy . After a year of marriage , Josiah is well enough to visit Paris , where Theodora sees her father , Dominic , again for the first time since her wedding . She is thrilled to observe that at least he is receiving all the benefits she d hoped to bring from her sacrifice : he now runs in aristocratic circles and is courting a wealthy American widow , Mrs. McBride . Theodora attends several social outings with her father , and at one dinner is introduced to Hector , Lord Bracondale . Theodora and Hector hit things off splendidly , and soon fall in love . Mrs. McBride is aware of Theodora s unhappy marriage , and seeing the situation she sympathetically arranges for Hector and Theodora to spend time together as often as possible . One day while Theodora and Hector are being chauffeured back to Paris after an outing at Versailles , the two indulge in a romantic encounter in the back of the car . Full of guilt thereafter , the two conclude they must behave themselves from now on and must no longer pursue each other romantically ; they will , however , continue to be friendly to one another any time future social obligations might cause them to meet . Hector at this point is terribly in love with Theodora , and though he tries his best to live by his promise to her , he still goes out of his way to see her and to secure invitations to all the same gatherings that she attends . He fantasizes about marrying her and makes sure to introduce her to his mother and to his sister . However , Theodora s status as a newcomer into society , and the obvious favor that Hector pays her over other eligible women who desire his hand , causes ire and jealousy to be directed her way . Rumors begin to spread , and several people believe Hector and Theodora to be lovers . Morella Winmarleigh , a spurned candidate for Hector s hand , particularly sets out destroy Theodora . She maliciously switches a letter Theodora had written to Hector with another letter meant for Josiah . Meanwhile , without anyone else s knowledge , Theodora and Hector have concluded that they can not attempt to remain friends any longertheir love is too strongand so they must agree to never see each other again . The next day , Josiah receives Theodora s letter meant for Hector : the contents amount to Theodora asking Hector never to see her again , even though the two of them could be very happy together , because it is her duty to instead attend to the happiness of her husband Josiah . Josiah realizes for the first time how he has stood in the way of Theodora s happiness , and resolves to do his best to make her happy from now on . He forwards the letter to Hector and requests he never allow Theodora to learn of the mix-up . The next several months pass with Theodora and Josiah both trying their best to make the other happy , even while both are secretly miserable . Both begin to suffer from ill health . Ultimately , Josiah dies ; eighteen months later , Mrs. McBride ( now married to Dominic Fitzgerald ) throws a picnic at Versailles to which both Theodora and Hector are invited . The book ends with the couple reunited , in a state of passionate love and delirious happiness .

The beautiful young Theodora Fitzgerald belongs to a family of noble lineage whose fortunes have waned and who have lived in near poverty for most of her life . The book begins with her arranged marriage to Josiah Brown , a nouveau-riche Australian in his fifties . The marriage was contracted for convenience : Josiah simply wants a pretty and aristocratic wife to improve his standing in society , and the Fitzgerald family are in need of Brown s financial resources . Theodora only agrees to the marriage for the sake of her father and sisters . Immediately after the wedding , Josiah falls ill. Theodora proves a dutiful and capable wife , and attends to her husband s every need , though she is secretly very unhappy . After a year of marriage , Josiah is well enough to visit Paris , where Theodora sees her father , Dominic , again for the first time since her wedding . She is thrilled to observe that at least he is receiving all the benefits she d hoped to bring from her sacrifice : he now runs in aristocratic circles and is courting a wealthy American widow , Mrs. McBride . Theodora attends several social outings with her father , and at one dinner is introduced to Hector , Lord Bracondale . Theodora and Hector hit things off splendidly , and soon fall in love . Mrs. McBride is aware of Theodora s unhappy marriage , and seeing the situation she sympathetically arranges for Hector and Theodora to spend time together as often as possible . One day while Theodora and Hector are being chauffeured back to Paris after an outing at Versailles , the two indulge in a romantic encounter in the back of the car . Full of guilt thereafter , the two conclude they must behave themselves from now on and must no longer pursue each other romantically ; they will , however , continue to be friendly to one another any time future social obligations might cause them to meet . Hector at this point is terribly in love with Theodora , and though he tries his best to live by his promise to her , he still goes out of his way to see her and to secure invitations to all the same gatherings that she attends . He fantasizes about marrying her and makes sure to introduce her to his mother and to his sister . However , Theodora s status as a newcomer into society , and the obvious favor that Hector pays her over other eligible women who desire his hand , causes ire and jealousy to be directed her way . Rumors begin to spread , and several people believe Hector and Theodora to be lovers . Morella Winmarleigh , a spurned candidate for Hector s hand , particularly sets out destroy Theodora . She maliciously switches a letter Theodora had written to Hector with another letter meant for Josiah . Meanwhile , without anyone else s knowledge , Theodora and Hector have concluded that they can not attempt to remain friends any longertheir love is too strongand so they must agree to never see each other again .

Part I The novel concerns the love triangle between Kate Cregeen and the two good friends and cousins , the illegitimate , poorly educated but good-hearted Peter Quilliam , and the well-educated and cultured Philip Christian . Kate s father rejects Pete s request to marry his daughter , due to his low prospects , and so Pete sets off to Kimberly , South Africa , to earn his fortune . He leaves Philip in charge of looking after Kate in his absence . Part II As Kate matures into an adult woman and Philip rises to become the foremost young lawyer in the island , they begin to fall in love . This is first openly spoken of between them when they hear rumours that Pete has died in Africa . However , the course of their love is still not open as Philip has to choose between worldly success and the position as Deemster , or his love of the lower class Kate . Feeling this push them apart , Kate is driven to an effort to hold on to the man whom life is tearing away from her by making a mistaken appeal to his love. Part III Pete returns to the island with a fortune fit to have his marriage proposal accepted by Kate s parents , while Kate is bed-ridden recovering from an illness brought about by Philip s breaking with her to stay true to his promise to Pete . Remaining unaware of anything between Philip and Kate , Pete arranges for the wedding , which Kate goes through with in a confused daze . Part IV Kate gives birth to a daughter which she realises is Philips . This fact , along with the reason for Kate s displeasure at the marriage , remains hidden to Pete , who proves himself to be a good and doting husband . When Kate informs Philip of the paternity of the baby girl , they arrange for her to live with him in secret . She leaves Pete s house to go to Philip on the evening when Pete is at the head of the crowd honouring Philip on his return to Ramsey , having been made Deemster . Part V Heart-broken at the disappearance of Kate , Pete looks to keep her memory in honour by pretending that she has gone to Liverpool to stay with a fictional uncle . To maintain this lie against the gossip of the town , Pete multiplies his lies in beginning to fake a written correspondence between Kate and himself . As Philip watches his friend s pathetic pretence , he feels the weight of his deceit , which causes him to take to drink and to pull away from Kate who has been secretly installed in his house . This situation continues until Kate leaves Philip so that he is relieved of his wretched situation . Part VI With Pete s fortune used up , his deception with the letters is found out and Kate is universally thought of as a fallen woman by everyone but Pete . Meanwhile , the child falls sick , the news of which reaches Kate where she had fled , in London . She returns to see the child where she again meets Pete before throwing herself into the harbour , attempting to end her shameful life . However , she is saved and immediately brought before the Deemster , Philip , to be tried . Philip realises who she is as he commits her to the prison in Castletown , and then faints . Whilst still in a swoon he is taken to Pete s house , where Pete hears Philip s feverish and unconscious confessions . However , instead of wreaking vengeance on Philip and Kate , Pete realises that he alone is the person in the way , and therefore wipes himself out in order that the woman he loves may be happy. So Pete determines to leave the island again , divorcing Kate before he goes and leaving Philip with the child and his best wishes . Philip then overcomes his final temptation , to take up the position of Governor , and confesses everything publicly and so unburdes himself . The final scene sees him retrieving Kate from prison to start life afresh .

Dorian Gray is the subject of a full-length portrait in oil by Basil Hallward , an artist who is impressed and infatuated by Dorian s beauty ; he believes that Dorians beauty is responsible for the new mode in his art as a painter . Through Basil , Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton , and he soon is enthralled by the aristocrat s hedonistic worldview : that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life . Newly understanding that his beauty will fade , Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul , to ensure that the picture , rather than he , will age and fade . The wish is granted , and Dorian pursues a libertine life of varied and amoral experiences , while staying young and beautiful ; all the while his portrait ages and records every bad sin.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins on a beautiful summer day in Victorian era England , where Lord Henry Wotton , an opinionated man , is observing the sensitive artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of Dorian Gray , a handsome young man who is Basil s ultimate muse . While sitting for the painting , Dorian listens to Lord Henry espousing his hedonistic world view , and begins to think that beauty is the only aspect of life worth pursuing . This prompts Dorian to wish that the painted image of himself would age instead of himself . Under the hedonist influence of Lord Henry , Dorian fully explores his sensuality . He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane , who performs Shakespeare plays in a dingy , working-class theatre . Dorian approaches and courts her , and soon proposes marriage . The enamoured Sibyl calls him Prince Charming , and swoons with the happiness of being loved , but her protective brother , James warns that if Prince Charming harms her , he will murder Dorian Gray . Dorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in Romeo and Juliet . Sibyl , too enamoured with Dorian to act , performs poorly , which makes both Basil and Lord Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her acting talent . Embarrassed , Dorian rejects Sibyl , telling her that acting was her beauty ; without that , she no longer interests him . On returning home , Dorian notices that the portrait has changed ; his wish has come true , and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty . Conscience-stricken and lonely , Dorian decides to reconcile with Sibyl , but he is too late , as Lord Henry informs him that Sibyl killed herself by swallowing prussic acid . Dorian then understands that , where his life is headed , lust and good looks shall suffice . Dorian locks the portrait up , and over the following eighteen years , he experiments with every vice , influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry Wotton gave him . [ The narrative does not reveal the title of the French novel , but , at trial , Wilde said that the novel Dorian Gray read was  Rebours ( Against Nature ' , 1884 ) , by Joris-Karl Huysmans . ] One night , before leaving for Paris , Basil goes to Dorian s house to ask him about rumours of his self-indulgent sensualism . Dorian does not deny his debauchery , and takes Basil to see the portrait . The portrait has become so hideous that Basil is only able to identify it as his work by the signature he affixes to all his portraits . Basil is horrified , and beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation . In anger , Dorian blames his fate on Basil , and stabs him dead . Dorian then calmly blackmails an old friend , the scientist Alan Campbell , into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy the body of Basil Hallward . Alan later kills himself over the deed . To escape the guilt of his crime , Dorian goes to an opium den , where James Vane is unknowingly present . James had been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl killed herself , but had no leads to pursue : the only thing he knew about Dorian was the name Sibyl called him by , Prince Charming . In the opium den however he hears someone refer to Dorian as Prince Charming , and he accosts Dorian . Dorian deceives James into believing that he is too young to have known Sibyl , who killed herself eighteen years earlier , as his face is still that of a young man . James relents and releases Dorian , but is then approached by a woman from the opium den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian . She confirms that the man was Dorian Gray and explains that he has not aged in eighteen years . James runs after Dorian , but he has gone . James then begins to stalk Dorian , causing Dorian to fear for his life . However during a shooting party , one of the hunters accidentally kills James Vane who was lurking in a thicket . On returning to London , Dorian tells Lord Henry that he will be good from then on ; his new probity begins with not breaking the heart of the nave Hetty Merton , his current romantic interest . Dorian wonders if his new-found goodness has reverted the corruption in the picture , but when he looks he sees only an even uglier image of himself . From that , Dorian understands that his true motives for the self-sacrifice of moral reformation were the vanity and curiosity of his quest for new experiences . Deciding that only full confession will absolve him of wrongdoing , Dorian decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience , and the only piece of evidence remaining of his crimesthe picture . In a rage , he takes the knife with which he murdered Basil Hallward , and stabs the picture . The servants of the house awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room ; on the street , passers-by who also heard the cry fetch the police . On entering the locked room , the servants find an unknown old man , stabbed in the heart , his face and figure withered and decrepit . The servants identify the disfigured corpse by the rings on his fingers to belong to their master ; beside him is the picture of Dorian Gray , restored to its original beauty .

Dorian then calmly blackmails an old friend , the scientist Alan Campbell , into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy the body of Basil Hallward . Alan later kills himself over the deed . To escape the guilt of his crime , Dorian goes to an opium den , where James Vane is unknowingly present . James had been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl killed herself , but had no leads to pursue : the only thing he knew about Dorian was the name Sibyl called him by , Prince Charming . In the opium den however he hears someone refer to Dorian as Prince Charming , and he accosts Dorian . Dorian deceives James into believing that he is too young to have known Sibyl , who killed herself eighteen years earlier , as his face is still that of a young man . James relents and releases Dorian , but is then approached by a woman from the opium den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian . She confirms that the man was Dorian Gray and explains that he has not aged in eighteen years . James runs after Dorian , but he has gone . James then begins to stalk Dorian , causing Dorian to fear for his life . However during a shooting party , one of the hunters accidentally kills James Vane who was lurking in a thicket .

Dorian wonders if his new-found goodness has reverted the corruption in the picture , but when he looks he sees only an even uglier image of himself . From that , Dorian understands that his true motives for the self-sacrifice of moral reformation were the vanity and curiosity of his quest for new experiences . Deciding that only full confession will absolve him of wrongdoing , Dorian decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience , and the only piece of evidence remaining of his crimesthe picture . In a rage , he takes the knife with which he murdered Basil Hallward , and stabs the picture . The servants of the house awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room ; on the street , passers-by who also heard the cry fetch the police . On entering the locked room , the servants find an unknown old man , stabbed in the heart , his face and figure withered and decrepit . The servants identify the disfigured corpse by the rings on his fingers to belong to their master ; beside him is the picture of Dorian Gray , restored to its original beauty .


Dorian Gray is the subject of a full-length portrait in oil by Basil Hallward , an artist who is impressed and infatuated by Dorian s beauty ; he believes that Dorians beauty is responsible for the new mode in his art as a painter . Through Basil , Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton , and he soon is enthralled by the aristocrat s hedonistic worldview : that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life . Newly understanding that his beauty will fade , Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul , to ensure that the picture , rather than he , will age and fade . The wish is granted , and Dorian pursues a libertine life of varied and amoral experiences , while staying young and beautiful ; all the while his portrait ages and records every bad sin.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins on a beautiful summer day in Victorian era England , where Lord Henry Wotton , an opinionated man , is observing the sensitive artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of Dorian Gray , a handsome young man who is Basil s ultimate muse . While sitting for the painting , Dorian listens to Lord Henry espousing his hedonistic world view , and begins to think that beauty is the only aspect of life worth pursuing . This prompts Dorian to wish that the painted image of himself would age instead of himself . Under the hedonist influence of Lord Henry , Dorian fully explores his sensuality . He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane , who performs Shakespeare plays in a dingy , working-class theatre . Dorian approaches and courts her , and soon proposes marriage . The enamoured Sibyl calls him Prince Charming , and swoons with the happiness of being loved , but her protective brother , James warns that if Prince Charming harms her , he will murder Dorian Gray . Dorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in Romeo and Juliet . Sibyl , too enamoured with Dorian to act , performs poorly , which makes both Basil and Lord Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her acting talent . Embarrassed , Dorian rejects Sibyl , telling her that acting was her beauty ; without that , she no longer interests him . On returning home , Dorian notices that the portrait has changed ; his wish has come true , and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty . Conscience-stricken and lonely , Dorian decides to reconcile with Sibyl , but he is too late , as Lord Henry informs him that Sibyl killed herself by swallowing prussic acid . Dorian then understands that , where his life is headed , lust and good looks shall suffice . Dorian locks the portrait up , and over the following eighteen years , he experiments with every vice , influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry Wotton gave him . [ The narrative does not reveal the title of the French novel , but , at trial , Wilde said that the novel Dorian Gray read was  Rebours ( Against Nature ' , 1884 ) , by Joris-Karl Huysmans . ] One night , before leaving for Paris , Basil goes to Dorian s house to ask him about rumours of his self-indulgent sensualism . Dorian does not deny his debauchery , and takes Basil to see the portrait . The portrait has become so hideous that Basil is only able to identify it as his work by the signature he affixes to all his portraits . Basil is horrified , and beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation . In anger , Dorian blames his fate on Basil , and stabs him dead . Dorian then calmly blackmails an old friend , the scientist Alan Campbell , into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy the body of Basil Hallward . Alan later kills himself over the deed . To escape the guilt of his crime , Dorian goes to an opium den , where James Vane is unknowingly present .

( Note : The following synopsis was that of Emma Goldman , as published in a 1914 collection entitled The Social Significance of the Moden Drama : ) The play opens in the office of James How & Sons , solicitors . The senior clerk , Robert Cokeson , discovers that a check he had issued for nine pounds has been forged to ninety . By elimination , suspicion falls upon William Falder , the junior office clerk . The latter is in love with a married woman , the abused and ill-treated wife of a brutal drunkard . Pressed by his employer , a severe yet not unkindly man , Falder confesses the forgery , pleading the dire necessity of his sweetheart , Ruth Honeywill , with whom he had planned to escape to save her from the unbearable brutality of her husband . Notwithstanding the entreaties of young Walter How , who holds modern ideas , his father , a moral and law-respecting citizen , turns Falder over to the police . The second act , in the court room , shows Justice in the very process of manufacture . The scene equals in dramatic power and psychologic verity the great court scene in Resurrection . Young Falder , a youth of twenty-three , stands before the bar . Ruth , his faithful sweetheart , full of love and devotion , burns with anxiety to save the young man , whose affection for her has brought about his present predicament . Falder is defended by Lawyer Frome , whose speech to the jury is a masterpiece of social philosophy . He does not attempt to dispute the mere fact that his client had altered the check ; and though he pleads temporary aberration in his defense , the argument is based on a social consciousness as fundamental and all-embracing as the roots of our social ills . He shows Falder to have faced the alternative of seeing the beloved woman murdered by her brutal husband , whom she can not divorce , or of taking the law into his own hands . He pleads with the jury not to turn the weak young man into a criminal by condemning him to prison . In prison the young , inexperienced convict soon finds himself the victim of the terrible system . The authorities admit that young Falder is mentally and physically in bad shape , but nothing can be done in the matter : many others are in a similar position , and the quarters are inadequate . The third scene of the third act takes place in Falder s prison cell . Falder leaves the prison , a broken man . Thanks to Ruth s pleading , the firm of James How & Son is willing to take Falder back in their employ , on condition that he give up Ruth . Falder resents this : It is then that Falder learns the awful news that the woman he loves had been driven by the chariot wheel of Justice to sell herself . At this moment the police appear to drag Falder back to prison for failing to report to the authorities as ticket-of-leave man . Completely overcome by the inexorability of his fate , Falder throws himself down the stairs , breaking his neck . The socio-revolutionary significance of Justice consists not only in the portrayal of the in-human system which grinds the Falders and Honeywills , but even more so in the utter helplessness of society as expressed in the words of the Senior Clerk , Cokeson , No one ll touch him now ! Never again ! He s safe with gentle Jesus !

At this moment the police appear to drag Falder back to prison for failing to report to the authorities as ticket-of-leave man . Completely overcome by the inexorability of his fate , Falder throws himself down the stairs , breaking his neck . The socio-revolutionary significance of Justice consists not only in the portrayal of the in-human system which grinds the Falders and Honeywills , but even more so in the utter helplessness of society as expressed in the words of the Senior Clerk , Cokeson , No one ll touch him now ! Never again ! He s safe with gentle Jesus !


( Note : The following synopsis was that of Emma Goldman , as published in a 1914 collection entitled The Social Significance of the Moden Drama : ) The play opens in the office of James How & Sons , solicitors . The senior clerk , Robert Cokeson , discovers that a check he had issued for nine pounds has been forged to ninety . By elimination , suspicion falls upon William Falder , the junior office clerk . The latter is in love with a married woman , the abused and ill-treated wife of a brutal drunkard . Pressed by his employer , a severe yet not unkindly man , Falder confesses the forgery , pleading the dire necessity of his sweetheart , Ruth Honeywill , with whom he had planned to escape to save her from the unbearable brutality of her husband . Notwithstanding the entreaties of young Walter How , who holds modern ideas , his father , a moral and law-respecting citizen , turns Falder over to the police . The second act , in the court room , shows Justice in the very process of manufacture . The scene equals in dramatic power and psychologic verity the great court scene in Resurrection . Young Falder , a youth of twenty-three , stands before the bar . Ruth , his faithful sweetheart , full of love and devotion , burns with anxiety to save the young man , whose affection for her has brought about his present predicament . Falder is defended by Lawyer Frome , whose speech to the jury is a masterpiece of social philosophy . He does not attempt to dispute the mere fact that his client had altered the check ; and though he pleads temporary aberration in his defense , the argument is based on a social consciousness as fundamental and all-embracing as the roots of our social ills . He shows Falder to have faced the alternative of seeing the beloved woman murdered by her brutal husband , whom she can not divorce , or of taking the law into his own hands . He pleads with the jury not to turn the weak young man into a criminal by condemning him to prison . In prison the young , inexperienced convict soon finds himself the victim of the terrible system . The authorities admit that young Falder is mentally and physically in bad shape , but nothing can be done in the matter : many others are in a similar position , and the quarters are inadequate . The third scene of the third act takes place in Falder s prison cell . Falder leaves the prison , a broken man . Thanks to Ruth s pleading , the firm of James How & Son is willing to take Falder back in their employ , on condition that he give up Ruth . Falder resents this : It is then that Falder learns the awful news that the woman he loves had been driven by the chariot wheel of Justice to sell herself . At this moment the police appear to drag Falder back to prison for failing to report to the authorities as ticket-of-leave man . Completely overcome by the inexorability of his fate , Falder throws himself down the stairs , breaking his neck . The socio-revolutionary significance of Justice consists not only in the portrayal of the in-human system which grinds the Falders and Honeywills , but even more so in the utter helplessness of society as expressed in the words of the Senior Clerk , Cokeson , No one ll touch him now !

The main character and the narrator in Armageddon 2419 A.D. is Anthony Rogers , who later appears in the various comic strips , radio shows , and film serials that follow as Buck Rogers . Rogers recounts the events of the Second War of Independence that precedes the first victory of Americans over Hans , in which he plays an important role . Born in 1898 , he was a veteran of the Great War ( World War I ) and was by 1927 working for the American Radioactive Gas Corporation . He was investigating reports of unusual phenomena in abandoned coal mines near Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania . On December 15 , while investigating one of the lower levels of a mine , there was a cave-in . Exposed to radioactive gas , Rogers fell into a state of suspended animation , free from the ravages of katabolic processes , and without any apparent effect on physical or mental faculties . Rogers remained in sleep for 492 years . He awakes in 2419 and , thinking that he has been asleep for just several hours , wanders for a few days in unfamiliar forests ( what had been Pennsylvania almost five centuries before ) . He finally notices a wounded boy-like-figure , clad in strange clothes and moving in giant leaps , who appears to be under attack by others . He defends the person , killing one of the attackers and scaring off the rest . It turns out that he is helping a woman , Wilma Deering , who , on air patrol , was attacked by an enemy gang , the Bad Bloods , which is presumed to have allied themselves with the Hans . Wilma takes Rogers to her camp , where he is to meet the bosses of her gang . He is invited to stay with their gang or leave and visit other gangs . They hope that Rogers experience and knowledge he gained fighting in the First World War may be useful in their struggle with the Hans . Rogers stays with the gang for several days , learns about the community life of Americans in the 25th century and makes friends with the people , especially with Wilma , with whom he spends a lot of time . He also experiences a Han air raid , during which he manages to destroy one of the enemy ships . Rogers and his friends hurry to the bosses to report the incident and explain the method he has used when shooting the aircraft . As the raid has caused much destruction , there is suspicion that the location of the gangs industrial plants may have been revealed to the Hans by rival gangs . They await a fight with the Hans who will likely wish to take revenge for the destruction of their airship . The bosses direct Wilma and Rogers to investigate the wreck . While there , a Han party arrives to investigate as well . Thanks to Rogers quick and wise instructions , he and Wilma manage to escape and also manage to shoot down some more of the Hans ships . The day after , Wilma and Anthony get married and Rogers becomes a member of the gang . Meantime , knowing Rogers technique , the other gangs start the hunt for Han ships . The Hans respond by improving the security of their ships , forcing the Americans to develop new tactics to press their sudden advantage and identify the traitors working with the Han . Anthony develops a plan to get the records of the traitorous transaction , which are kept somewhere in the Han city of Nu-Yok . With the help of other gangs , he creates a team that will go with him . They learn that the traitors are the Sinsings , the gang located not far from Nu-Yok . The Americans appreciate Rogers courage and brave deeds and , grateful to him , make him the new boss . He instantly reorganizes the governing structures of the gang by creating new offices and makes plans for the battle with the Sinsings , again using the knowledge he gained in the First World War . The raid on Sinsings turns out to be a great success and gives the Americans the confidence in their ability to overcome the Hans .

While there , a Han party arrives to investigate as well . Thanks to Rogers quick and wise instructions , he and Wilma manage to escape and also manage to shoot down some more of the Hans ships . The day after , Wilma and Anthony get married and Rogers becomes a member of the gang . Meantime , knowing Rogers technique , the other gangs start the hunt for Han ships . The Hans respond by improving the security of their ships , forcing the Americans to develop new tactics to press their sudden advantage and identify the traitors working with the Han . Anthony develops a plan to get the records of the traitorous transaction , which are kept somewhere in the Han city of Nu-Yok . With the help of other gangs , he creates a team that will go with him . They learn that the traitors are the Sinsings , the gang located not far from Nu-Yok . The Americans appreciate Rogers courage and brave deeds and , grateful to him , make him the new boss . He instantly reorganizes the governing structures of the gang by creating new offices and makes plans for the battle with the Sinsings , again using the knowledge he gained in the First World War . The raid on Sinsings turns out to be a great success and gives the Americans the confidence in their ability to overcome the Hans .


The main character and the narrator in Armageddon 2419 A.D. is Anthony Rogers , who later appears in the various comic strips , radio shows , and film serials that follow as Buck Rogers . Rogers recounts the events of the Second War of Independence that precedes the first victory of Americans over Hans , in which he plays an important role . Born in 1898 , he was a veteran of the Great War ( World War I ) and was by 1927 working for the American Radioactive Gas Corporation . He was investigating reports of unusual phenomena in abandoned coal mines near Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania . On December 15 , while investigating one of the lower levels of a mine , there was a cave-in . Exposed to radioactive gas , Rogers fell into a state of suspended animation , free from the ravages of katabolic processes , and without any apparent effect on physical or mental faculties . Rogers remained in sleep for 492 years . He awakes in 2419 and , thinking that he has been asleep for just several hours , wanders for a few days in unfamiliar forests ( what had been Pennsylvania almost five centuries before ) . He finally notices a wounded boy-like-figure , clad in strange clothes and moving in giant leaps , who appears to be under attack by others . He defends the person , killing one of the attackers and scaring off the rest . It turns out that he is helping a woman , Wilma Deering , who , on air patrol , was attacked by an enemy gang , the Bad Bloods , which is presumed to have allied themselves with the Hans . Wilma takes Rogers to her camp , where he is to meet the bosses of her gang . He is invited to stay with their gang or leave and visit other gangs . They hope that Rogers experience and knowledge he gained fighting in the First World War may be useful in their struggle with the Hans . Rogers stays with the gang for several days , learns about the community life of Americans in the 25th century and makes friends with the people , especially with Wilma , with whom he spends a lot of time . He also experiences a Han air raid , during which he manages to destroy one of the enemy ships . Rogers and his friends hurry to the bosses to report the incident and explain the method he has used when shooting the aircraft .

The narrator recounts three instances of incredible coincidences and suggests that forces greater than chance play important roles in life . Police officer Jim Kurring investigates a disturbance at a woman s apartment , finding a body in a closet . Dixon , a neighborhood boy , tries to tell him who committed the murder but Jim is dismissive . Jim goes to the apartment of Claudia Wilson . Claudia s neighbors called the police after she had an argument with her estranged father , children s game show host Jimmy Gator , and then blasted music while snorting cocaine . Unaware of her addiction , Jim is attracted to her and prolongs the visit . He asks her on a date that night ; she says yes . Jimmy hosts a long-running quiz show called What Do Kids Know ? and is dying of cancer ; he has only a few months to live . That night the newest child prodigy on What Do Kids Know ? , Stanley Spector , takes the lead as the show begins . He is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the surrounding adults , who refuse to let him use the bathroom during a commercial break . When the show resumes , he wets himself and freezes , humiliated when everyone realizes what happened . As the show continues an inebriated Jimmy sickens , and he orders the show to go on after he collapses onstage . But after Stanley s father berates him for freezing on air , Stanley refuses to return for the final round . Donnie Smith , a former What Do Kids Know ? champion , watches the show from a bar . Donnie s parents spent the money he won as a child , and he has been fired from his job at Solomon & Solomon , an electronics store , due to chronic lateness and poor sales . He is obsessed with getting oral surgery , thinking he will land the man of his dreams after he gets braces . He hatches a plan to get back at his boss by stealing the money he needs for his braces . The show s former producer , Earl Partridge , is also dying of cancer . Earl s trophy wife , Linda , collects his prescriptions for morphine while he is cared for by a nurse , Phil Parma . Earl asks Phil to find his estranged son , Frank Mackey , a motivational speaker peddling a pick-up artist self-help course to men . Frank is in the midst of an interview with a journalist who reveals that she knows Frank had to take care of his dying mother after Earl abandoned the family . An angry Frank storms out of the interview when Phil gets through to him . Linda goes to see Earl s lawyer , begging him to change Earl s will . She admits she married Earl for his money , but now loves him and does not want it . The lawyer suggests she renounce the will and refuse the money , which would go to Frank . Linda rejects his advice and leaves in a rage . Linda berates Phil for seeking out Frank , but later apologizes . She drives to a vacant parking lot and washes down handfuls of prescription medicine with alcohol . Dixon finds Linda in her car , near death , and calls an ambulance after taking money from her purse . Before his date with Claudia , Jim takes fire during a pursuit and loses his gun . When he meets Claudia they promise to be honest with each other , so he confesses his ineptitude as a cop and admits he has not been on a date since he was divorced three years earlier . Claudia says he will hate her because of her problems , but Jim assures her that her past does not matter . They kiss , but she runs off . Jimmy Gator goes home to his wife Rose and confesses that he cheated on her . She asks why Claudia does not talk to him , and Jimmy admits that Claudia believes he molested her . Rose demands to know if it is true , but Jimmy says he can not remember whether he abused Claudia . Rose tells Jimmy he deserves to die alone , and she walks out on him . Jimmy decides to kill himself . Donnie takes money from the Solomon & Solomon safe . As he drives away , he decides to return the money , but discovers he can not get back in as his key broke off in the lock . While climbing a utility pole to get on the roof , he is seen by a passing Jim . Suddenly , frogs begin falling from the sky , with multiple consequences : as Jimmy is about to shoot himself , frogs fall through his skylight , causing him to shoot the TV which sets his house on fire ; Rose crashes her car in front of Claudia s apartment , but makes it inside and reconciles with her daughter ; Earl dies as Frank watches the frogs ; Linda s ambulance crashes in front of the emergency room ; and , Donnie is knocked from the pole and smashes his teeth , then is dragged to safety by Jim . Jim counsels Donnie and helps him return the money ; his gun falls from the sky . Frank goes to the hospital to be with Linda , who will recover from her attempted suicide . Stanley , on his way to bed , tells his father that he needs to be nicer to him , but his father ignores him and simply tells him to go to bed . Jim goes to see Claudia , telling her he wants to make things work between them ; she smiles in reply .

Several residents of a Paris boarding-house write letters to their friends and family back home ; their primary subject is their reaction to each other . The main character is Miranda Hope , an angular but likeable Yankee Miss from Bangor , Maine who , quite bravely for a young woman of that era , is traveling in Europe alone . In her letters , she chatters to her mother about seeing the sights in Europe but does n't like the Old World s treatment of its women , and that is a point , you know , on which I feel very strongly . Her expressions of petulance with William Platt , who we realize must have been a suitor of hers back in Maine , are so offhand as to be amusing . Although she is in general the least affected and most sympathetic character in the story , her unawareness of the disdain in which most of the characters hold each other ( including herself ) makes her seem somewhat naive . Meanwhile , society girl Violet Ray of New York writes to a friend that Miranda , who she sees as provincial , is really too horrible . Another boarder , wannabe aesthete Louis Leverett ( quite possibly a self-satire by James ) gushes in his letter that the great thing is to live , you know , amid much precious verbiage about the good , the true and the bee-a-u-tiful . An English boarder , Evelyn Vane , pens a scoffing note that Louis is always talking about the color of the sky , but she doubts if he s ever seen it except through a window-pane ; and the German sees Leverett s decadence as further evidence that the English-speaking world is weak and ripe for takeover . The Frenchman Leon Verdier almost drools in his letter about the charms of ces demoiselles among the boarders , and focuses primarily on their appearance . The rather threatening German professor is the only character both cynical and intelligent enough to realize how disdainful all the English speakers are of each other . However , he s also the least sympathetic character in the story . ( James disliked Germany and its culture . ) While the other characters despise each other mostly on personal grounds , or from cultural misunderstanding , Herr Professor despises them all based on their national traits and general sub-human status ( he calls the Frenchman simian ) . In a letter to his German friend , he simultaneously brags of his erudition and predicts that the weakness of these other nationalities augurs a bright future for the deep-lunged children of the Fatherland !

The dialogue takes place in Socrates ' prison cell , where he awaits execution . He is visited before dawn by his old friend Crito , who has made arrangements to smuggle Socrates out of prison to the safety of exile . Socrates seems quite willing to await his imminent execution , and so Crito presents as many arguments as he can to persuade Socrates to escape . On a practical level , Socrates ' death will reflect badly on his friends -- people will think they did nothing to try to save him . Also , Socrates should not worry about the risk or the financial cost to his friends ; these they are willing to pay , and they have also arranged to find Socrates a pleasant life in exile . On a more ethical level , Crito presents two more pressing arguments : first , if he stayed , he would be aiding his enemies in wronging him unjustly , and would thus be acting unjustly himself ; and second , that he would be abandoning his sons and leaving them without a father . Socrates answers first that one should not worry about public opinion , but only listen to wise and expert advice . Crito should not worry about how his , Socrates ' , or others ' reputations may fare in the general esteem : they should only concern themselves with behaving well . The only question at hand is whether or not it would be just for Socrates to attempt an escape . If it is just , he will go with Crito , if it is unjust , he must remain in prison and face death . At this point , Socrates introduces the voice of the Laws of Athens , which speaks to him and proceeds to explain why it would be unjust for him to leave his cell . Since the Laws exist as one entity , to break one would be to break them all , and in doing so , Socrates would cause them great harm . The citizen is bound to the Laws like a child is bound to a parent , and so to go against the Laws would be like striking a parent . Rather than simply break the Laws and escape , Socrates should try to persuade the Laws to let him go . These Laws present the citizen s duty to them in the form of a kind of social contract . By choosing to live in Athens , a citizen is implicitly endorsing the Laws , and is willing to abide by them . Socrates , more than most , should be in accord with this contract , as he has lived a happy seventy years fully content with the Athenian way of life . If Socrates were to break from prison now , having so consistently validated the social contract , he would be making himself an outlaw who would not be welcome in any other civilized state for the rest of his life . And when he dies , he will be harshly judged in the underworld for behaving unjustly toward his city s laws . Thus , Socrates convinces Crito that it would be better not to attempt an escape .

Karl Childers ( Billy Bob Thornton ) is an intellectually disabled Arkansas man who has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12 for having killed his mother and her lover . Although thoroughly institutionalized , Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world . Prior to his release , he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter , to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade , saying , Some folks call it a sling blade . I call it a kaiser blade . Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother . When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair , he killed her also . Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization ( James Hampton ) , Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised . He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley ( Lucas Black ) and shares some of the details of his past , including the killings . Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own . He later admits that he lied , and that his father committed suicide . Frank introduces Karl to his mother , Linda ( Natalie Canerday ) , as well as her gay friend , Vaughan Cunningham ( John Ritter ) , the manager of the dollar store where she is employed . Despite Vaughan s concerns about Karl s history in the mental hospital , Linda allows him to move into her garage , which angers Linda s abusive alcoholic boyfriend , Doyle Hargraves ( Dwight Yoakam ) . Karl bonds with Linda , who makes him biscuits to eat , and also with Vaughan , who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America . Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank , who misses his father and despises Doyle . Karl is haunted by the task given to him by his parents when he was six or eight years old to dispose of his premature , unwanted , newborn brother . He visits his father ( Robert Duvall ) , who has become a mentally unbalanced hermit living in the dilapidated home where Karl grew up . Karl s parents performed an abortion , causing the baby to come out too soon , and Karl was given a bloody towel wrapped around the baby , which survived the abortion . Karl was instructed to get rid of it , but when Karl detected movement inside the towel , he inspected it , discovering a little ol ' boy that was n't no bigger than a squirrel . While recounting this story to Frank , Frank asks why Karl just did n't keep the baby , but Karl replies he had no way to care for a baby . He placed the baby , still in the bloody towel , inside a shoe box and buried the baby alive , saying he felt it was better to just return him to the good Lord right off the bat , because of the abuse and neglect he himself had received at the hands of his own parents . Karl tells his father that killing the baby was wrong , and that he had wanted to kill his father for making him do it , but eventually decided that he was n't worth the effort . Meanwhile , Doyle becomes increasingly abusive towards Karl and Frank , leading to an eventual drunken outburst and physical confrontation with Linda and Frank , angering the boy . Linda then kicks Doyle out of the house ( despite his threats to kill her if she ever left him ) . The next day , Linda and Doyle reconcile . Knowing that he has the upper hand again , Doyle confronts Karl and Frank and announces his plan to move into the house permanently ; he plans big changes including Karl s removal from the house . Karl begins to realize that , eventually , Frank is going to kill Doyle and end up just like him . In order to prevent this , Karl makes Frank promise to spend the night at Vaughan s house , and asks Vaughan to pick up Linda from work and have her stay over also . Karl returns to Linda s house , but seems undecided about whether to enter . When confronted , a drunk Doyle asks what Karl is doing with the lawnmower blade he had sharpened and fashioned into a weapon . Karl replies , I aim to kill you with it . Karl asks how to reach the police by phone , Doyle says Karl should dial 911 and request an ambulance , or a hearst ' . Karl kills Doyle with two chopping blows of the lawnmower blade to the head . Karl then calls the police to turn himself in , and requests a hearst be sent for Doyle . He eats biscuits while waiting for the police . Returned to the state hospital , he seems a different person than he was during his previous incarceration , having learned the value of sacrificing one s self to save others . He silences a sexual predator ( played by J. T. Walsh ) who had previously forced him to listen to tales of his horrible deeds .


Karl Childers ( Billy Bob Thornton ) is an intellectually disabled Arkansas man who has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12 for having killed his mother and her lover . Although thoroughly institutionalized , Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world . Prior to his release , he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter , to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade , saying , Some folks call it a sling blade . I call it a kaiser blade . Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother . When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair , he killed her also . Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization ( James Hampton ) , Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised . He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley ( Lucas Black ) and shares some of the details of his past , including the killings . Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own . He later admits that he lied , and that his father committed suicide . Frank introduces Karl to his mother , Linda ( Natalie Canerday ) , as well as her gay friend , Vaughan Cunningham ( John Ritter ) , the manager of the dollar store where she is employed . Despite Vaughan s concerns about Karl s history in the mental hospital , Linda allows him to move into her garage , which angers Linda s abusive alcoholic boyfriend , Doyle Hargraves ( Dwight Yoakam ) . Karl bonds with Linda , who makes him biscuits to eat , and also with Vaughan , who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America . Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank , who misses his father and despises Doyle . Karl is haunted by the task given to him by his parents when he was six or eight years old to dispose of his premature , unwanted , newborn brother . He visits his father ( Robert Duvall ) , who has become a mentally unbalanced hermit living in the dilapidated home where Karl grew up .

The story takes place in Nepalese plain land-Kapilvastu . Siddhartha decides to leave behind his home in the hope of gaining spiritual illumination by becoming an ascetic wandering beggar of the Shramanas . Joined by his best friend Govinda , Siddhartha fasts , becomes homeless , renounces all personal possessions , and intensely meditates , eventually seeking and personally speaking with Gautama , the famous Buddha , or Enlightened One . Afterward , both Siddhartha and Govinda acknowledge the elegance of the Buddha s teachings . Although Govinda hastily joins the Buddha s order , Siddhartha does not follow , claiming that the Buddha s philosophy , though supremely wise , does not account for the necessarily distinct experiences of each person . He argues that the individual seeks an absolutely unique and personal meaning that can not be presented to him by a teacher . He thus resolves to carry on his quest alone . Siddhartha crosses a river , and the generous ferryman , whom Siddhartha is unable to pay , merrily predicts that Siddhartha will return to the river later to compensate him in some way . Venturing onward toward city life , Siddhartha discovers Kamala , the most beautiful woman he has yet seen . Kamala , a courtesan , notes Siddhartha s handsome appearance and fast wit , telling him that he must become wealthy to win her affections so that she may teach him the art of love . Although Siddhartha despised materialistic pursuits as a Shramana , he agrees now to Kamala s suggestions . She directs him to the employ of Kamaswami , a local businessman , and insists that he have Kamaswami treat him as an equal rather than an underling . Siddhartha easily succeeds , providing a voice of patience and tranquility , which Siddhartha learned from his days as an ascetic , against Kamaswami s fits of passion . Thus Siddhartha becomes a rich man and Kamala s lover , though in his middle years he realizes that the luxurious lifestyle he has chosen is merely a game , empty of spiritual fulfillment . Leaving the fast-paced bustle of the city , Siddhartha returns to the river and thinks of killing himself . He is saved only by an internal experience of the holy word , Om . The very next morning Siddhartha briefly reconnects with Govinda , who is passing through the area as a wandering Buddhist . Siddhartha decides to live out the rest of his life in the presence of the spiritually inspirational river . Siddhartha thus reunites with the ferryman , named Vasudeva , with whom he begins a humbler way of life . Although Vasudeva is a simple man , he understands and relates that the river has many voices and significant messages to divulge to any who might listen . Some years later , Kamala , now a Buddhist convert , is travelling to see the Buddha at his deathbed , accompanied reluctantly by her young son , when she is bitten by a venomous snake near Siddhartha s river . Siddhartha recognizes her and realizes that the boy is his own child . After Kamala s death , Siddhartha attempts to console and raise the furiously resistant boy , until one day the child flees altogether . Although Siddhartha is desperate to find his runaway son , Vasudeva urges him to let the boy find his own path , much like Siddhartha did himself in his youth . Listening to the river with Vasudeva , Siddhartha realizes that time is an illusion and that all of his feelings and experiences , even those of suffering , are part of a great and ultimately jubilant fellowship of all things connected in the cyclical unity of nature . After Siddhartha s moment of illumination , Vasudeva claims that his work is done and he must depart into the woods , leaving Siddhartha peacefully fulfilled and alone once more . Toward the end of his life , Govinda hears about an enlightened ferryman and travels to Siddhartha , not initially recognizing him as his old childhood friend . Govinda asks the now-elderly Siddhartha to relate his wisdom and Siddhartha replies that for every true statement there is an opposite one that is also true ; that language and the confines of time lead people to adhere to one fixed belief that does not account for the fullness of the truth . Because nature works in a self-sustaining cycle , every entity carries in it the potential for its opposite and so the world must always be considered complete . Siddhartha simply urges people to identify and love the world in its completeness . Siddhartha then requests that Govinda kiss his forehead and , when he does , Govinda experiences the visions of timelessness that Siddhartha himself saw with Vasudeva by the river . Govinda bows to his wise friend and Siddhartha smiles radiantly , having found enlightenment .

Siddhartha thus reunites with the ferryman , named Vasudeva , with whom he begins a humbler way of life . Although Vasudeva is a simple man , he understands and relates that the river has many voices and significant messages to divulge to any who might listen . Some years later , Kamala , now a Buddhist convert , is travelling to see the Buddha at his deathbed , accompanied reluctantly by her young son , when she is bitten by a venomous snake near Siddhartha s river . Siddhartha recognizes her and realizes that the boy is his own child . After Kamala s death , Siddhartha attempts to console and raise the furiously resistant boy , until one day the child flees altogether . Although Siddhartha is desperate to find his runaway son , Vasudeva urges him to let the boy find his own path , much like Siddhartha did himself in his youth . Listening to the river with Vasudeva , Siddhartha realizes that time is an illusion and that all of his feelings and experiences , even those of suffering , are part of a great and ultimately jubilant fellowship of all things connected in the cyclical unity of nature . After Siddhartha s moment of illumination , Vasudeva claims that his work is done and he must depart into the woods , leaving Siddhartha peacefully fulfilled and alone once more . Toward the end of his life , Govinda hears about an enlightened ferryman and travels to Siddhartha , not initially recognizing him as his old childhood friend . Govinda asks the now-elderly Siddhartha to relate his wisdom and Siddhartha replies that for every true statement there is an opposite one that is also true ; that language and the confines of time lead people to adhere to one fixed belief that does not account for the fullness of the truth . Because nature works in a self-sustaining cycle , every entity carries in it the potential for its opposite and so the world must always be considered complete . Siddhartha simply urges people to identify and love the world in its completeness . Siddhartha then requests that Govinda kiss his forehead and , when he does , Govinda experiences the visions of timelessness that Siddhartha himself saw with Vasudeva by the river . Govinda bows to his wise friend and Siddhartha smiles radiantly , having found enlightenment .


Holmes and Dr. Watson find themselves in Cornwall one spring for the formers health , but the holiday ends with a bizarre event . Mr. Mortimer Tregennis , a local gentleman , and Mr. Roundhay , the local vicar , come to Holmes to report that Tregenniss two brothers have gone insane , and his sister has died . Tregennis had gone to visit them in their village ( Tredannick Wollas ) , played whist with them , and then left . When he came back in the morning , he found them still sitting in their places at the table , the brothers , George and Owen , laughing and singing , and the sister , Brenda , dead . The housekeeper had discovered them in this state , and fainted . The vicar has not been to see them yet . Tregennis says that he remembers one brother looking through the window , and then he himself turned to see some movement outside . He declares that the horrific event is the work of the devil . Mortimer Tregennis was once estranged from his siblings by the matter of dividing the proceeds from the sale of the family business , but he insists that all was forgiven , although he still lives apart from them . The doctor who was summoned , reckoned that she had been dead for six hours . He also collapsed into a chair for a while after arriving . Holmes goes to the house in question and , apparently carelessly , kicks over a watering pot , soaking everyones feet . The housekeeper tells Holmes that she heard nothing in the night , and that the family had been particularly happy and prosperous lately . Holmes observes the remains of a fire in the fireplace . Tregennis explains that it was a cold , damp night .

Almayers Folly is about a poor businessman who dreams of finding a hidden gold mine and becoming very wealthy . He is a white European , married to a native Malayan ; they have one daughter named Nina . He fails to find the goldmine , and comes home saddened . Previously , he had heard that the British were to conquer the Pantai River , and he had built a large , lavish house near where he resided at the time , in order to welcome the invading country to the native land . However , the conquest never took place , and the house remained unfinished . Some passing Dutch seamen had called the house Almayers Folly . Now , Almayer continually goes out for long trips , but eventually he stops doing so and stays home with his hopeless daydreams of riches and splendor . His native wife loathes him for this . One day , a Malayan prince , Dain Maroola , came to see Almayer about trading , and while there he falls in love with Nina . Mrs. Almayer kept arranging meetings for Nina and Dain . She wanted them to marry so her daughter could stay native , because she was highly distrustful of the white men and their ways . Dain left but vowed to return to help Almayer find the gold mine . When he does return , he goes straight to Lakamba , a Malayan rajah , and told him that he found the gold mine and that some Dutchmen had captured his ship . The rajah tells him to kill Almayer before the Dutch arrive because he is not needed to find the gold now . The following morning , an unidentifiable native corpse is found floating in the river , wearing an ankle bracelet very similar to Dains . Almayer was distraught because Dain was his only chance at finding the secret mine . ( The corpse was actually of his slave , who had died when a canoe overturned . Mrs. Almayer suggested that Dain put his anklet and ring on the body . ) Mrs. Almayer planned to smuggle Dain away from the Dutch , so he would not be arrested . She snuck Nina away from her father , who was drinking with the Dutch . When he awoke from his drunken stupor , a native slave girl told him where Nina had run away to , and Almayer tracked her to Dains hiding place . Nina refused to go back to avoid the slurs of all the white society . During all this arguing , the slave girl had informed the Dutch of Dains whereabouts . Almayer said that he could never forgive Nina but would help them escape by taking them to the mouth of the river , where a canoe would rescue them from the Dutch . After they had escaped , Almayer erased the lovers footprints , and went back to his house . Mrs. Almayer ran away to the rajah for protection , taking all Dains dowry with her . All alone , Almayer broke all his furniture in his home office , piled it in the center of the room , and burned it , along with his entire house , to the ground . He spent the rest of his days in  [ His ] Folly , where he began smoking opium to forget his daughter . He eventually died there .

Jason Voorhees ( Kane Hodder ) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility . In 2010 , a government scientist decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him . While Private Samuel Johnson ( Jeff Geddis ) places a blanket on Jason , Dr. Wimmer ( David Cronenberg ) , Sergeant Marcus ( Markus Parilo ) , and a few soldiers hope to further research Jason s rapid cellular regeneration and try to take Jason . They pull off the blanket covering his body , but find Johnson dead , instead . Having broken free of his restraints , Jason kills the soldiers and Wimmer . Rowan ( Lexa Doig ) lures Jason into a cryogenic pod and activates it . Jason then ruptures the pod with his machete and stabs Rowan in the abdomen , spilling cryogenic fluid into the sealed room and freezing them both . Over 445 years later , in 2455 , Earth has become too polluted to support life and humans have moved to a new planet , Earth Two . Three students , Tsunaron ( Chuck Campbell ) , Janessa ( Melyssa Ade ) , and Azrael ( Dov Tiefenbach ) , are on a field trip led by Professor Braithwaite Lowe ( Jonathan Potts ) , who is accompanied by an Android robot , KM-14 ( Lisa Ryder ) . They enter the Crystal Lake facility and find the still-frozen Jason and Rowan , whom they bring to their spaceship , the Apache . Also on the ship are Lowe s remaining students , Kinsa ( Melody Johnson ) , Waylander ( Derwin Jordan ) , and Stoney ( Yani Gellman ) . They reanimate Rowan while Jason is pronounced dead and left in the morgue . Lowe s intern , Adrienne Thomas ( Kristi Angus ) , is ordered to dissect Jason s body . Lowe , who is in serious debt , calls his financial backer Dieter Perez ( Robert A. Silverman ) , of the Solaris , who notes that Jason s body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector . While Stoney has sex with Kinsa , Jason comes back to life and attacks Adrienne , then freezes her face with liquid nitrogen before smashing her head to pieces on a counter . Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and makes his way through the ship . He stabs Stoney in the chest and drags him away to his death , to Kinsa s horror . Sergeant Brodski ( Peter Mensah ) leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason . Meanwhile , Jason attacks and kills Dallas by bashing his skull against the wall after breaking Azrael s back . He then tries to attack Crutch , but Brodski and his soldiers save him . Jason disappears , and after Brodski splits up his team , Jason kills them one by one . Lowe orders Pilot Lou ( Boyd Banks ) to dock in on Solaris . As he is talking with the Solaris engineer , he is hacked apart by Jason . With no pilot , the ship crashes through a nearby space station , destroying it , and killing Dieter Perez and everyone else on the Solaris . The crash damages one of the Grendel s pontoon sections . Jason breaks into the lab , reclaims his machete and decapitates Lowe . With the ship badly damaged , the remaining survivors head for Grendel s shuttle , while Tsunaron heads elsewhere with KM-14 . After finding Lou s remains , Crutch ( Philip Williams ) and Waylander prepare the shuttle . Rowan finds Brodski , but he is too heavy for her to carry , so she leaves to get help . Waylander leaves to help with him , while Crutch prepares the shuttle . Jason kills Crutch by electrocution . On board the shuttle , Kinsa has a panic attack and launches the shuttle without releasing the fuel line , causing it to crash into the ship s hull and explode , killing her . Brodski attacks Jason , but is overpowered . Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14 , complete with an array of weapons and new combat skills . She fights Jason off and seemingly kills him , knocking him into a nanite-equipped medical station and blasting off his right arm , left leg , right rib cage , and , finally , part of his head . The survivors send a distress call and receive a reply from a patrol shuttle . The survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section . As they work , Jason is accidentally brought back to life by the damaged medical station , rebuilt as an even more powerful cyborg called Uber Jason . Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off . As Tsunaron picks up her still-functioning head , Jason attacks them , but is stopped by Waylander , who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape . Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle . He punches a hole through the hull , blowing out Janessa . A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go EVA to fix it . Meanwhile , a hard light holographic simulation of Crystal Lake is created to distract Jason , but he sees through the deception just as the door is fixed . Brodski confronts Jason so that the rest can escape . As they leave , the pontoon explodes , propelling Jason at high speed towards the survivors ; however , Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and maneuvers them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two , incinerating them . Tsunaron assures KM-14 that he will build a new body for her . On the planet , two teens beside a lake see what they believe is a falling star as Jason s charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake .

Lowe , who is in serious debt , calls his financial backer Dieter Perez ( Robert A. Silverman ) , of the Solaris , who notes that Jason s body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector . While Stoney has sex with Kinsa , Jason comes back to life and attacks Adrienne , then freezes her face with liquid nitrogen before smashing her head to pieces on a counter . Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and makes his way through the ship . He stabs Stoney in the chest and drags him away to his death , to Kinsa s horror . Sergeant Brodski ( Peter Mensah ) leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason . Meanwhile , Jason attacks and kills Dallas by bashing his skull against the wall after breaking Azrael s back . He then tries to attack Crutch , but Brodski and his soldiers save him . Jason disappears , and after Brodski splits up his team , Jason kills them one by one . Lowe orders Pilot Lou ( Boyd Banks ) to dock in on Solaris . As he is talking with the Solaris engineer , he is hacked apart by Jason . With no pilot , the ship crashes through a nearby space station , destroying it , and killing Dieter Perez and everyone else on the Solaris . The crash damages one of the Grendel s pontoon sections . Jason breaks into the lab , reclaims his machete and decapitates Lowe . With the ship badly damaged , the remaining survivors head for Grendel s shuttle , while Tsunaron heads elsewhere with KM-14 . After finding Lou s remains , Crutch ( Philip Williams ) and Waylander prepare the shuttle . Rowan finds Brodski , but he is too heavy for her to carry , so she leaves to get help . Waylander leaves to help with him , while Crutch prepares the shuttle . Jason kills Crutch by electrocution . On board the shuttle , Kinsa has a panic attack and launches the shuttle without releasing the fuel line , causing it to crash into the ship s hull and explode , killing her . Brodski attacks Jason , but is overpowered . Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14 , complete with an array of weapons and new combat skills . She fights Jason off and seemingly kills him , knocking him into a nanite-equipped medical station and blasting off his right arm , left leg , right rib cage , and , finally , part of his head . The survivors send a distress call and receive a reply from a patrol shuttle . The survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section . As they work , Jason is accidentally brought back to life by the damaged medical station , rebuilt as an even more powerful cyborg called Uber Jason . Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off . As Tsunaron picks up her still-functioning head , Jason attacks them , but is stopped by Waylander , who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape . Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle . He punches a hole through the hull , blowing out Janessa . A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go EVA to fix it . Meanwhile , a hard light holographic simulation of Crystal Lake is created to distract Jason , but he sees through the deception just as the door is fixed . Brodski confronts Jason so that the rest can escape . As they leave , the pontoon explodes , propelling Jason at high speed towards the survivors ; however , Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and maneuvers them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two , incinerating them . Tsunaron assures KM-14 that he will build a new body for her . On the planet , two teens beside a lake see what they believe is a falling star as Jason s charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake .


Jason Voorhees ( Kane Hodder ) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility . In 2010 , a government scientist decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him . While Private Samuel Johnson ( Jeff Geddis ) places a blanket on Jason , Dr. Wimmer ( David Cronenberg ) , Sergeant Marcus ( Markus Parilo ) , and a few soldiers hope to further research Jason s rapid cellular regeneration and try to take Jason . They pull off the blanket covering his body , but find Johnson dead , instead . Having broken free of his restraints , Jason kills the soldiers and Wimmer . Rowan ( Lexa Doig ) lures Jason into a cryogenic pod and activates it . Jason then ruptures the pod with his machete and stabs Rowan in the abdomen , spilling cryogenic fluid into the sealed room and freezing them both . Over 445 years later , in 2455 , Earth has become too polluted to support life and humans have moved to a new planet , Earth Two . Three students , Tsunaron ( Chuck Campbell ) , Janessa ( Melyssa Ade ) , and Azrael ( Dov Tiefenbach ) , are on a field trip led by Professor Braithwaite Lowe ( Jonathan Potts ) , who is accompanied by an Android robot , KM-14 ( Lisa Ryder ) .

While Private Samuel Johnson ( Jeff Geddis ) places a blanket on Jason , Dr. Wimmer ( David Cronenberg ) , Sergeant Marcus ( Markus Parilo ) , and a few soldiers hope to further research Jason s rapid cellular regeneration and try to take Jason . They pull off the blanket covering his body , but find Johnson dead , instead . Having broken free of his restraints , Jason kills the soldiers and Wimmer . Rowan ( Lexa Doig ) lures Jason into a cryogenic pod and activates it . Jason then ruptures the pod with his machete and stabs Rowan in the abdomen , spilling cryogenic fluid into the sealed room and freezing them both . Over 445 years later , in 2455 , Earth has become too polluted to support life and humans have moved to a new planet , Earth Two . Three students , Tsunaron ( Chuck Campbell ) , Janessa ( Melyssa Ade ) , and Azrael ( Dov Tiefenbach ) , are on a field trip led by Professor Braithwaite Lowe ( Jonathan Potts ) , who is accompanied by an Android robot , KM-14 ( Lisa Ryder ) . They enter the Crystal Lake facility and find the still-frozen Jason and Rowan , whom they bring to their spaceship , the Apache . Also on the ship are Lowe s remaining students , Kinsa ( Melody Johnson ) , Waylander ( Derwin Jordan ) , and Stoney ( Yani Gellman ) . They reanimate Rowan while Jason is pronounced dead and left in the morgue . Lowe s intern , Adrienne Thomas ( Kristi Angus ) , is ordered to dissect Jason s body . Lowe , who is in serious debt , calls his financial backer Dieter Perez ( Robert A. Silverman ) , of the Solaris , who notes that Jason s body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector . While Stoney has sex with Kinsa , Jason comes back to life and attacks Adrienne , then freezes her face with liquid nitrogen before smashing her head to pieces on a counter . Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and makes his way through the ship . He stabs Stoney in the chest and drags him away to his death , to Kinsa s horror . Sergeant Brodski ( Peter Mensah ) leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason . Meanwhile , Jason attacks and kills Dallas by bashing his skull against the wall after breaking Azrael s back . He then tries to attack Crutch , but Brodski and his soldiers save him . Jason disappears , and after Brodski splits up his team , Jason kills them one by one . Lowe orders Pilot Lou ( Boyd Banks ) to dock in on Solaris . As he is talking with the Solaris engineer , he is hacked apart by Jason . With no pilot , the ship crashes through a nearby space station , destroying it , and killing Dieter Perez and everyone else on the Solaris . The crash damages one of the Grendel s pontoon sections . Jason breaks into the lab , reclaims his machete and decapitates Lowe . With the ship badly damaged , the remaining survivors head for Grendel s shuttle , while Tsunaron heads elsewhere with KM-14 . After finding Lou s remains , Crutch ( Philip Williams ) and Waylander prepare the shuttle . Rowan finds Brodski , but he is too heavy for her to carry , so she leaves to get help . Waylander leaves to help with him , while Crutch prepares the shuttle . Jason kills Crutch by electrocution . On board the shuttle , Kinsa has a panic attack and launches the shuttle without releasing the fuel line , causing it to crash into the ship s hull and explode , killing her . Brodski attacks Jason , but is overpowered . Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14 , complete with an array of weapons and new combat skills . She fights Jason off and seemingly kills him , knocking him into a nanite-equipped medical station and blasting off his right arm , left leg , right rib cage , and , finally , part of his head . The survivors send a distress call and receive a reply from a patrol shuttle . The survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section . As they work , Jason is accidentally brought back to life by the damaged medical station , rebuilt as an even more powerful cyborg called Uber Jason . Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off . As Tsunaron picks up her still-functioning head , Jason attacks them , but is stopped by Waylander , who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape . Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle . He punches a hole through the hull , blowing out Janessa . A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go EVA to fix it . Meanwhile , a hard light holographic simulation of Crystal Lake is created to distract Jason , but he sees through the deception just as the door is fixed . Brodski confronts Jason so that the rest can escape . As they leave , the pontoon explodes , propelling Jason at high speed towards the survivors ; however , Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and maneuvers them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two , incinerating them . Tsunaron assures KM-14 that he will build a new body for her . On the planet , two teens beside a lake see what they believe is a falling star as Jason s charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake .

Julianne Potter ( Julia Roberts ) , a 27-year-old New York City restaurant critic , receives a call from her lifelong friend Michael O'Neal ( Dermot Mulroney ) . In college , the two made an agreement that if neither of them were married by the time they turned 28 , they would marry each other . Three weeks before her 28th birthday , Michael tells her that in four days , he will marry Kimmy Wallace ( Cameron Diaz ) , a 20-year-old University of Chicago student from a wealthy family . Julianne is disappointed that Michael will marry someone so wrong for him , and someone he has known for such a short period of time . She realizes that she is in love with Michael , and heads to Chicago , intent on sabotaging his wedding . Soon after arriving she meets Kimmy , who asks her to be the maid of honor . This sets off a subplot in which Julianne must pretend to be the dutiful maid of honor while secretly scheming ways to prevent the wedding from happening . She engages in petty sabotagefor example , taking Kimmy and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimmy is a terrible singerand later asks her gay friend and editor George Downes ( Rupert Everett ) to pretend they are engaged , hoping to make Michael jealous . When these tactics fail , George persuades Julianne to do the obvious : tell Michael she is in love with him . One morning , Michael gets Julianne alone and tells her that it ll be the last time they ever get to be alone . He expresses some skepticism in marrying Kimmy , explaining that he and Kimmy do n't share a special song like he and Julianne do . Michael discreetly gives Julianne the invitation to tell him she s in love with him , but she lets the moment pass her by . Michael starts singing their song as he grabs Julianne and holds her while they dance one last time . Juliannes unauthorized use of Kimmys fathers computer to forge an email message to Michaels employer causes further problems for Michael and Kimmy , to the point where they are on the verge of calling off the wedding . The next morning , the day of the wedding , Julianne tries to sabotage the situation further ; as Michael and Kimmy are not speaking to each other , they communicate through Julianne , not realizing she is trying to manipulate them into breaking up for good . In spite of this , Michael and Kimmy decide they do love each other and want to get married after all . Julianne and Michael then take a walk , with Julianne finally confessing her love to Michael . She asks him to marry her instead , and passionately kisses him . Kimmy witnesses this , and runs off , but Michael chases her . Julianne pursues him , but finally realizes Michael loves Kimmy . Julianne finds Michael at Chicago Union Station , where he is looking for Kimmy , and confesses all to him . Despite his anger at her deception , Michael forgives Julianne , and they split up to look for Kimmy . Julianne then tracks down Kimmy in the bathroom of Comiskey Park ( Kimmy s family has a private viewing box at the stadium ) . Kimmy , rightly furious with Julianne , confronts her . To which the other women watch , immediately siding with Kimmy and are disgusted with Julianne s dirty tactics . Julianne , however , apologizes and explains to Kimmy that she kissed Michael unexpectedly , but he did n't kiss her back because he was in love with Kimmy . Julianne declares that Kimmy has won , and that she accepts Michael s decision . Kimmy and Julianne reconcile with each other . After the wedding , at the reception , Julianne tells Michael that he and Kimmy can use their special song until they find one of their own , essentially acting like a true best friend . Julianne wishes them well , and she and Michael share their goodbyes , both of them finally moving on with their lives . Later , Julianne is surprised by George showing up at the wedding reception . The movie ends with the two of them happily sharing a dance together on the dance floor .

The plot of The Witch of Atlas revolves around the travels and adventures of a mysterious and mythical Witch who lives in a cave on Atlas ' mountain by a secret fountain and who creates a hermaphrodite by strange art kneading together fire and snow , a creature , Hermaphroditus , a sexless thing , with both male and female characteristics , with pinions , or wings . A fair Shape out of her hands did flow because all things together grow/ Through which the harmony of love can pass . In Greek mythology , Hermaphrodite was the offspring of Hermes and Aphrodite . The hermaphrodite is androgynous and synthesises the opposing and contradictory aspects of the creative mind . The hermaphrodite is both the companion and the servant to the Witch . The journeys consist of sailing in the air on an airship and in water on a boat , or pinnace . They travel from the Atlas Mountains to the Austral Lake to the Nile Valley . Nature is explored as are fire and electrical energy . The Witch begins her sojourn from the ancient northern Ethiopian city of Axume . Lake Moeris , an ancient lake southwest of Cairo , Egypt , is visited , as are the Mareotid lakes south of Alexandria . King Amasis of Egypt , Memphis , and the bull god Apis are invoked . The forces of creation and destruction are resolved . The objective is a synthesis or union of contradictions . The Witch is the daughter of the Atlantides , who in Greek mythology are called the Pleiades , the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione . Her home , the Atlas Mountains , are a range that stretches across north Africa , from Morocco and Algeria to Tunisia . Her choice sport was to glide adown the Nile River into Egypt and Aethiopia with tame water-snakes and ghastly alligators . She observed mankind at sleep . Injustice and inequality were noted : And pale imaginings of visioned wrong ; / And all the code of Custom s lawless law/ Written upon the brows of old and young . It is this oppression and exploitation that trouble mankind s existence : This ... is the strife/ Which stirs the liquid surface of man s life . ' The visionary rhyme recounts the pranks the Witch plays on mankind . Like Shelley himself , the Witch was able to perceive the fears and desires of mankind : In mine own heart I saw as in a glass/ The hearts of others . She is able to see the naked beauty of the human soul . The Witch gave a strange panacea in a crystal bowl to those who were the most beautiful and imparted strange dreams to those who were less beautiful . The Witch sought to change man s perception of death . Death was not to be feared . The Witch took a coffin and threw it with contempt into a ditch . The grave was as a green and overarching bower/ Lit by the gems of many a starry flower . She sought to make the world more just and fair by making more vain all those purposes which were harsh and crooked . The miser would place all his evil gain on a beggar s lap . The scribe would reveal his own lies . Priests would reject dogma and old cant . The king would place an ape on his throne and dress him up in his vestments while a mock-bird repeated the chatterings of the monkey . War would be practised no more as soldiers turned their swords into ploughshares on red anvils . Finally , timid lovers would see the fulfilment of their inmost thought . These are the pranks the Witch played among the cities of mortal men . The Witch was able to envision and foresee a future Utopia for all mankind .

When a flying saucer lands in Washington , D.C. , the Army quickly surrounds the spaceship . A humanoid ( Michael Rennie ) emerges , announcing that he has come in peace . As he advances , he unexpectedly opens a small device and is shot by a nervous soldier . A tall robot emerges from the saucer and quickly disintegrates the soldiers ' weapons with an energy ray . The alien orders the robot , Gort , to stop . He explains that the broken device was a gift for the President , which would have enabled him to study life on the other planets . The alien is taken to Walter Reed Hospital , where he reveals his name : Klaatu . After surgery , Klaatu uses a salve to quickly heal himself . Meanwhile , the military is unable to enter his saucer ; Gort stands outside , silent and unmoving . Klaatu tells the President s secretary , Mr. Harley ( Frank Conroy ) , that he has a message that must be delivered to all the world s leaders simultaneously . Harley tells him that such a meeting in the current political climate is impossible . Klaatu suggests that he be allowed to go among humans to better understand their unreasoning suspicions and attitudes . Harley rejects the proposal and leaves Klaatu under guard . Klaatu escapes and lodges at a boarding house as Mr. Carpenter , the name on the dry cleaner s tag on the suit he borrowed . Among the residents are young widow Helen Benson ( Patricia Neal ) and her son Bobby ( Billy Gray ) . The next morning , Klaatu listens to the boarders speculate about why the alien has come . While Helen and her boyfriend Tom Stephens ( Hugh Marlowe ) go out , Klaatu babysits Bobby . The boy takes Klaatu on a tour of the city , including a visit to his father s grave in Arlington National Cemetery ; Klaatu learns that most of those buried there were killed in wars . The two visit the Lincoln Memorial , then the heavily guarded spaceship . Klaatu asks Bobby who is the greatest living person ; Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt ( Sam Jaffe ) , who lives in the capital . Bobby takes Klaatu to Barnhardt s home , but the professor is absent . Klaatu adds a mathematical equation to a problem on Barnhardt s blackboard and leaves his contact information with the suspicious housekeeper . That evening , a government agent takes Klaatu to Barnhardt . Klaatu explains that the people of the other planets have safety concerns now that humanity has developed rockets and a rudimentary form of atomic power . Klaatu declares that if his message is ignored , Earth will be eliminated . Barnhardt agrees to gather scientists from around the world at the spaceship ; he then suggests that Klaatu give a harmless demonstration of his power . Klaatu returns to his ship that night , unaware that Bobby has followed him . Bobby sees Gort knock out two sentries and Mr. Carpenter enter the spaceship . Bobby tells Helen and Tom what he saw , but they do not believe him until Tom takes a diamond he found in Klaatu s room to a jeweler and learns it is unlike any other on Earth . Klaatu finds Helen at her workplace , and they take an empty service elevator which abruptly stops precisely at noon . Klaatu reveals his identity and his mission , then asks for her help . He has neutralized all electricity everywhere , except for such things as hospitals and aircraft in flight . Exactly 30 minutes later , the blackout ends . When Tom informs the military of his suspicions , Helen breaks up with him . Helen and Klaatu take a taxi to Barnhardt s home . En route , he tells her that should anything happen to him , she must tell Gort Klaatu barada nikto . Klaatu s taxi is spotted and hemmed in ; he makes a break for it and is gunned down . Helen quickly heads to the saucer . Gort disintegrates both sentries and advances on her . When Helen utters Klaatu s three words , the robot carries her into the saucer , then leaves to retrieve Klaatu s body . Later , Gort revives Klaatu . Klaatu explains to Helen that his revival is only temporary , that the power of life and death is reserved for the Almighty Spirit . Klaatu and Helen emerge from the spaceship and tells Barnhardt s assembled scientists that the people of Earth can join the other planets in peace , but should they threaten to extend their violence into space , this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder . Klaatu and Gort then fly away .


When a flying saucer lands in Washington , D.C. , the Army quickly surrounds the spaceship . A humanoid ( Michael Rennie ) emerges , announcing that he has come in peace . As he advances , he unexpectedly opens a small device and is shot by a nervous soldier . A tall robot emerges from the saucer and quickly disintegrates the soldiers ' weapons with an energy ray . The alien orders the robot , Gort , to stop . He explains that the broken device was a gift for the President , which would have enabled him to study life on the other planets . The alien is taken to Walter Reed Hospital , where he reveals his name : Klaatu . After surgery , Klaatu uses a salve to quickly heal himself . Meanwhile , the military is unable to enter his saucer ; Gort stands outside , silent and unmoving . Klaatu tells the President s secretary , Mr. Harley ( Frank Conroy ) , that he has a message that must be delivered to all the world s leaders simultaneously . Harley tells him that such a meeting in the current political climate is impossible .

Goblin Market is about two close sisters , Laura and Lizzie , as well as the goblins to whom the title refers . Although the sisters seem to be quite young , they live by themselves in a house , and are accustomed to draw water every evening from a stream . As the poem begins , twilight is falling , and as usual , the sisters hear the calls from the goblin merchants , who sell fruits in fantastic abundance , variety and savour . On this evening , Laura lingers at the stream after her sister has left for home , intrigued by the goblins ' strange manner and appearance . ( Rossetti hints that the goblin men resemble animalsfor example , having faces like wombats or cats , and possessing tails . ) Longing for the goblin fruits but having no money , the impulsive Laura offers a lock of her hair and a tear more rare than pearl . Laura gorges on the delicious fruit in a sort of bacchic frenzy , then once she is finished , after picking up one of the seeds , returns home in an ecstatic trance . Lizzie , waiting at home , and full of wise upbraidings , reminds Laura about the cautionary tale of Jeanie , another girl , who , having likewise partaken of the goblins ' fruits , died just at the beginning of winter , after a long and pathetic decline . Strangely , no grass grows over Jeanie s grave . Laura dismisses her sister s worries , and says she shall return to the goblins the next night and return with more fruits for herself and Lizzie . That night , the sisters go to sleep in their shared bed . The next day , as Laura and Lizzie go about their work in the house , Laura dreamily longs for the coming evening s meeting with the goblins . However , at the stream that evening , as she strains to hear the usual goblin chants and cries , Laura discovers to her horror that , although Lizzie still hears the goblins ' voices , she can not . Unable to buy more of the forbidden fruit , and sickening for the lack of it , Laura falls into a slow physical deterioration and depression . As winter approaches , she withers away , aging at an unnatural rate and physically unable to do her accustomed household work . One day she remembers the saved seed and plants it , but nothing grows . Months pass , and Lizzie realizes that Laura is on the verge of death . Lizzie resolves to visit the goblins to buy some of their fruit , hoping to soothe Laura s pain . Carrying a silver penny , Lizzie goes down to the brook and is greeted in a friendly way by the goblins , who invite her to sit and dine with them . When they realize , however , that the Lizzie means to pay with mere silver to buy the goblin-fruits to help another person , they turn upon the girl . The goblins viciously pummel and assault Lizzie , and try to feed her their fruits by force . In the process , they drench the brave girl in fruit juice and pulpbut Lizzie ingests none of the goblin fruit . Lizzie escapes and runs home , hoping that Laura will eat and drink the pulp and juice from her body . Her dying sister does so , but the taste of the fruit repulses her rather than satisfies her hunger . Laura then undergoes a violent transformation of such intensity that her life seems to hang in the balance . By morning , however , Laura is restored , emotionally , physically , and mentally . The last stanza attests that both Laura and Lizzie live to tell their children of the evils of the goblins ' fruitsand the powers of sisterly love .

In the process , they drench the brave girl in fruit juice and pulpbut Lizzie ingests none of the goblin fruit . Lizzie escapes and runs home , hoping that Laura will eat and drink the pulp and juice from her body . Her dying sister does so , but the taste of the fruit repulses her rather than satisfies her hunger . Laura then undergoes a violent transformation of such intensity that her life seems to hang in the balance . By morning , however , Laura is restored , emotionally , physically , and mentally . The last stanza attests that both Laura and Lizzie live to tell their children of the evils of the goblins ' fruitsand the powers of sisterly love .


Goblin Market is about two close sisters , Laura and Lizzie , as well as the goblins to whom the title refers . Although the sisters seem to be quite young , they live by themselves in a house , and are accustomed to draw water every evening from a stream . As the poem begins , twilight is falling , and as usual , the sisters hear the calls from the goblin merchants , who sell fruits in fantastic abundance , variety and savour . On this evening , Laura lingers at the stream after her sister has left for home , intrigued by the goblins ' strange manner and appearance . ( Rossetti hints that the goblin men resemble animalsfor example , having faces like wombats or cats , and possessing tails . ) Longing for the goblin fruits but having no money , the impulsive Laura offers a lock of her hair and a tear more rare than pearl . Laura gorges on the delicious fruit in a sort of bacchic frenzy , then once she is finished , after picking up one of the seeds , returns home in an ecstatic trance . Lizzie , waiting at home , and full of wise upbraidings , reminds Laura about the cautionary tale of Jeanie , another girl , who , having likewise partaken of the goblins ' fruits , died just at the beginning of winter , after a long and pathetic decline . Strangely , no grass grows over Jeanie s grave . Laura dismisses her sister s worries , and says she shall return to the goblins the next night and return with more fruits for herself and Lizzie . That night , the sisters go to sleep in their shared bed . The next day , as Laura and Lizzie go about their work in the house , Laura dreamily longs for the coming evening s meeting with the goblins . However , at the stream that evening , as she strains to hear the usual goblin chants and cries , Laura discovers to her horror that , although Lizzie still hears the goblins ' voices , she can not . Unable to buy more of the forbidden fruit , and sickening for the lack of it , Laura falls into a slow physical deterioration and depression . As winter approaches , she withers away , aging at an unnatural rate and physically unable to do her accustomed household work . One day she remembers the saved seed and plants it , but nothing grows . Months pass , and Lizzie realizes that Laura is on the verge of death . Lizzie resolves to visit the goblins to buy some of their fruit , hoping to soothe Laura s pain . Carrying a silver penny , Lizzie goes down to the brook and is greeted in a friendly way by the goblins , who invite her to sit and dine with them .

This novel introduces Natty Bumppo as Deerslayer : a young frontiersman in early 18th-century New York , who objects to the practice of taking scalps , on grounds that every living thing should follow the gifts of its nature , which would keep European Americans from taking scalps . Two characters who actually seek to take scalps are Deerslayer s foil Henry March ( alias Hurry Harry ) and the former pirate Floating Tom ' Hutter , to whom Deerslayer is introduced en route to a rendezvous with the latter s lifelong friend Chingachgook ( initially apparent in The Last of the Mohicans ) . Shortly before the rendezvous , Hutter s residence is besieged by the indigenous Hurons , and Hutter and March sneak into the camp of the besiegers to kill and scalp as many as they can ; but are captured in the act , and later ransomed by Bumppo , Chingachgook , and Hutter s daughters Judith and Hetty . Bumppo and Chingachgook thereafter plan to rescue Chingachgook s kidnapped betrothed Wah-ta-Wah ( alias Hist ' ) from the Hurons ; but , in rescuing her , Bumppo is captured . In his absence , the Hurons invade Hutter s home , and Hutter is scalped alive . On his deathbed , he confesses that Judith and Hetty were not his daughters by birth , and Judith determines to discover her natural father s identity ; but her search reveals only that her late mother had been of aristocratic descent , and had married Floating Tom ' after the collapse of an illicit affair . Later , Judith attempts and fails to rescue Deerslayer ; and they are all saved at last when March returns with English reinforcements , who massacre the Hurons and mortally wound Hetty . After Hetty s death , Judith proposes marriage to Deerslayer , but is refused , and is last described as the paramour of a soldier . Fifteen years later , Bumppo and Chingachgook return to the site , to find Hutter s house in ruins .

The story concerns a love triangle . The protagonist , Dick Forrest , is a rancher with a poetic streak ( his acorn song recalls London s play , The Acorn Planters. ) . His wife , Paula , is a vivacious , athletic , and sexually self-aware woman ( in one scene , she rides a stallion into a swimming tank , emerging in a white silken slip of a bathing suit that molded to her form like a marble-carven veiling of drapery . ) Paula , like Charmian , is subject to insomnia ; and Paula , like Charmian , is unable to bear children . Based on a reading of Charmian s diary , Stasz identifies the third vertex of the triangle , Evan Graham , with two real-life men named Laurie Smith and Allan Dunn . Even minor characters can be identified ; Forrest s servant Oh My resembles London s valet Nakata . The long-bearded hobo philosopher Aaron Hancock resembles the real-lifelong-bearded hobo philosopher Frank Strawn-Hamilton , who was a long-term guest at the London ranch . Sculptor Haakan Frolich makes an appearance as the sculptor Froelig  and painter Xavier Martinez appears as the character Xavier Martinez ! The novel ends with Paula wounding herself mortally with a riflethe reader is not told explicitly whether it is suicide , as her lover Graham believes , or an accident , as she tells her husbandand convincing a doctor to inject her with an overdose of morphine . As she drifts off , she says goodbye to both of her lovers : Two bonnie , bonnie men . Good-by , bonnie men . Good-by , Red Cloud ... . Stretch the skin tight , first .

Captain Jean-Luc Picard wakes from a nightmare in which he relived his assimilation by the cybernetic Borg six years earlier ( shown in the television episode The Best of Both Worlds ) . Starfleet informs him of a new Borg attack against Earth , but orders the USS Enterprise-E to patrol the Romulan Neutral Zone so as not to introduce an unstable element to the fight . Learning that the fleet is losing the battle , the Enterprise crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth , where a single , damaged Borg Cube opposes a group of Starfleet vessels . The Enterprise arrives in time to save the crew of the USS Defiant , which is being commanded by Lieutenant Commander Worf . After Picard hears Borg communications in his mind , he orders the fleet to concentrate its firepower on a seemingly non-vital section of the Borg ship . The Cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards the planet . The Borg sphere generates and enters a temporal vortex . As the Enterprise is enveloped in the vortex , the crew briefly glimpses an Earth populated entirely by Borg . Picard realizes that the Borg have used time travel to change history , and orders the Enterprise to follow . The Enterprise arrives in the past , on April 4 , 2063 , the day before humanity s first encounter with alien life after Zefram Cochrane s historic warp flight . The Borg sphere fires on the planet ; the Enterprise crew then destroy the sphere and , realizing that the Borg were trying to prevent first contact , send an away team to the Montana missile complex where Cochrane is building his ship , the Phoenix , to look for survivors . Picard sends Cochrane s assistant Lily Sloane to the Enterprise for medical attention , then returns to the ship and leaves Commander William Riker on Earth to make sure the Phoenix s flight proceeds as planned . The Enterprise crew sees Cochrane as a legend , but the real man is reluctant to assume his historical role . Borg survivors invade the Enterprise , and begin to assimilate its crew and modify the ship , planning to use it to attack and conquer Earth . Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with corrosive coolant used in the warp core , but the android Data is captured and meets the queen of the Borg Collective , who gains his trust by giving part of him human skin . A frightened Sloane seizes the captain but he gains her trust , and they escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by using the holodeck . Picard , Worf , and the ship s navigator , Lieutenant Hawk , stop the Borg from calling reinforcements with the deflector dish , but Hawk is assimilated . As the Borg continue to assimilate , Worf suggests destroying the ship , but Picard angrily calls him a coward and vows to continue the fight . Sloane confronts the captain and , reminding him of Moby-Dick s Captain Ahab , makes him realize his own irrational behavior . Picard activates the ship s self-destruct mechanism , orders the crew to abandon ship , and then apologizes to Worf . While the crew heads to escape pods , Picard remains aboard to rescue Data . As Cochrane , Riker , and engineer Geordi La Forge prepare to activate the warp drive on the Phoenix , Picard confronts the Borg Queen and discovers she has grafted human skin onto Data , giving him an array of new sensations . She has presented this modification as a gift to the android , hoping to obtain his encryption codes to the Enterprise computer . Although Picard offers himself in Data s place , the android refuses to leave . He deactivates the self-destruct sequence and fires torpedoes at the Phoenix , but they miss and the Queen realizes Data has betrayed her . Data ruptures a coolant tank , and the corrosive substance fatally dissolves the Borg s biological components . Cochrane completes his warp flight , and that night , April 5 , 2063 , the crew watches as Vulcans , attracted by the Phoenix warp flight , land and greet Cochrane . Having repaired history , the Enterprise crew returns to the 24th century .

Captain Jean-Luc Picard wakes from a nightmare in which he relived his assimilation by the cybernetic Borg six years earlier ( shown in the television episode The Best of Both Worlds ) . Starfleet informs him of a new Borg attack against Earth , but orders the USS Enterprise-E to patrol the Romulan Neutral Zone so as not to introduce an unstable element to the fight . Learning that the fleet is losing the battle , the Enterprise crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth , where a single , damaged Borg Cube opposes a group of Starfleet vessels . The Enterprise arrives in time to save the crew of the USS Defiant , which is being commanded by Lieutenant Commander Worf . After Picard hears Borg communications in his mind , he orders the fleet to concentrate its firepower on a seemingly non-vital section of the Borg ship . The Cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards the planet . The Borg sphere generates and enters a temporal vortex . As the Enterprise is enveloped in the vortex , the crew briefly glimpses an Earth populated entirely by Borg . Picard realizes that the Borg have used time travel to change history , and orders the Enterprise to follow . The Enterprise arrives in the past , on April 4 , 2063 , the day before humanity s first encounter with alien life after Zefram Cochrane s historic warp flight . The Borg sphere fires on the planet ; the Enterprise crew then destroy the sphere and , realizing that the Borg were trying to prevent first contact , send an away team to the Montana missile complex where Cochrane is building his ship , the Phoenix , to look for survivors . Picard sends Cochrane s assistant Lily Sloane to the Enterprise for medical attention , then returns to the ship and leaves Commander William Riker on Earth to make sure the Phoenix s flight proceeds as planned . The Enterprise crew sees Cochrane as a legend , but the real man is reluctant to assume his historical role . Borg survivors invade the Enterprise , and begin to assimilate its crew and modify the ship , planning to use it to attack and conquer Earth . Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with corrosive coolant used in the warp core , but the android Data is captured and meets the queen of the Borg Collective , who gains his trust by giving part of him human skin . A frightened Sloane seizes the captain but he gains her trust , and they escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by using the holodeck .

The film opens in what will become North Texas , 35,000 BC . Entering a cave , two cavemen hunters stumble upon a large extraterrestrial life form . One is killed by the creature while the other one fights and wins , stabbing the creature to death , but he is also infected by a black oil-like substance which crawls into his skin . In 1998 , in the same area , when a group of boys are digging a deep hole , a young boy named Stevie falls down the hole and finds a human skull . As he holds it , black oil seeps into his body until it reaches his head , causing his eyes to turn black . Later , four firefighters descend into the hole to rescue him , but do not come out . A team of biohazard-suited men arrives on the scene . Meanwhile , FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully have been assigned to other projects since the closure of the X-Files . They are helping investigate a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas . Mulder inspects a building across the street from the supposed target and discovers the bomb in a vending machine . Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud stays behind to disarm the bomb as Mulder and Scully evacuate the building . Unknown to the agents , Michaud makes no effort to disarm the bomb , which detonates . Returning to Washington , D.C. , Mulder and Scully are chastised because , in addition to Michaud , five people were apparently still in the building during the bombing . There are scheduled separate hearings at which their job performances will be evaluated . That evening , Mulder encounters a paranoid doctor , Alvin Kurtzweil , who explains that the victims were the firefighters and boy , that they were already dead , and that the bomb was allowed to detonate in order to destroy evidence of how they died . At the hospital morgue , Scully is able to examine one of the victims , finding evidence of an alien virus . Meanwhile , Mulder and Scully s enemy , the Cigarette Smoking Man , meets with Dr. Ben Bronschweig in Texas , which they locate one of the firefighters who contains the same alien virus , but with an alien organism residing inside the body ; the Cigarette Smoking Man orders to administer a vaccine to it , but should it fail , have the body burned . Later , the alien organism gestates and kills Bronschweig . Mulder and Scully travel to the crime scene in Texas . They come across a strange train hauling tanker trucks and they follow it to a large cornfield surrounding two glowing domes . They enter the domes , only to find them empty . Suddenly , grates leading to an underground area open in the floor and a swarm of bees chases the agents out into the cornfield . Black helicopters appear and begin to chase them , but they escape and head back to Washington . After returning , Mulder unsuccessfully tries to get help from Kurtzweil , while Scully attends her performance hearing and learns that she is being transferred to Salt Lake City , Utah . Mulder is devastated to lose Scully as a partner . The two are about to share a kiss when Scully is stung by a bee which had lodged itself under her shirt collar . The sting causes Scully to quickly lose consciousness . Mulder calls for the paramedics but when an ambulance arrives , the driver shoots Mulder in the head and whisks Scully away . Waking up in hospital , Mulder is told the bullet only grazed his temple and leaves with the help of The Lone Gunmen and FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner . Mulder then meets a former adversary , the Well-Manicured Man , who gives him Scully s location in Antarctica , along with a vaccine to combat the virus that has infected her . The Well-Manicured Man then kills himself in a car bomb , before his betrayal of The Syndicate is discovered . Mulder travels to Antarctica to save Scully , and discovers a secret underground laboratory run by the Cigarette Smoking Man . Mulder uses the vaccine to revive Scully , disrupting the stable environment of the lab and reviving the cocooned aliens . The lab is destroyed just after Mulder and Scully escape to the surface . It turns out to be part of a huge alien vessel lying dormant beneath the snow ; the vessel pushes up through tons of ice and snow and travels straight up into the sky . Mulder watches the ship fly directly overhead and disappear into the distance , as Scully regains consciousness . Some time later , Scully attends a hearing , where her testimony is ignored and the evidence covered up . The only remaining proof of their ordeal is the bee that stung Scully , collected by the Lone Gunmen . She hands it over , noting that the FBI does not currently have an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence at hand . Outside , Mulder is reading an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas ; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him . At another crop outpost in Tunisia , the Cigarette Smoking Man warns Strughold that Mulder remains a threat , as he explains what Mulder has found out about the virus . He then hands him a telegram revealing that the X-files unit has been re-opened .

After returning , Mulder unsuccessfully tries to get help from Kurtzweil , while Scully attends her performance hearing and learns that she is being transferred to Salt Lake City , Utah . Mulder is devastated to lose Scully as a partner . The two are about to share a kiss when Scully is stung by a bee which had lodged itself under her shirt collar . The sting causes Scully to quickly lose consciousness . Mulder calls for the paramedics but when an ambulance arrives , the driver shoots Mulder in the head and whisks Scully away . Waking up in hospital , Mulder is told the bullet only grazed his temple and leaves with the help of The Lone Gunmen and FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner . Mulder then meets a former adversary , the Well-Manicured Man , who gives him Scully s location in Antarctica , along with a vaccine to combat the virus that has infected her . The Well-Manicured Man then kills himself in a car bomb , before his betrayal of The Syndicate is discovered . Mulder travels to Antarctica to save Scully , and discovers a secret underground laboratory run by the Cigarette Smoking Man . Mulder uses the vaccine to revive Scully , disrupting the stable environment of the lab and reviving the cocooned aliens . The lab is destroyed just after Mulder and Scully escape to the surface . It turns out to be part of a huge alien vessel lying dormant beneath the snow ; the vessel pushes up through tons of ice and snow and travels straight up into the sky . Mulder watches the ship fly directly overhead and disappear into the distance , as Scully regains consciousness . Some time later , Scully attends a hearing , where her testimony is ignored and the evidence covered up . The only remaining proof of their ordeal is the bee that stung Scully , collected by the Lone Gunmen . She hands it over , noting that the FBI does not currently have an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence at hand . Outside , Mulder is reading an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas ; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him . At another crop outpost in Tunisia , the Cigarette Smoking Man warns Strughold that Mulder remains a threat , as he explains what Mulder has found out about the virus . He then hands him a telegram revealing that the X-files unit has been re-opened .


The film opens in what will become North Texas , 35,000 BC . Entering a cave , two cavemen hunters stumble upon a large extraterrestrial life form . One is killed by the creature while the other one fights and wins , stabbing the creature to death , but he is also infected by a black oil-like substance which crawls into his skin . In 1998 , in the same area , when a group of boys are digging a deep hole , a young boy named Stevie falls down the hole and finds a human skull . As he holds it , black oil seeps into his body until it reaches his head , causing his eyes to turn black . Later , four firefighters descend into the hole to rescue him , but do not come out . A team of biohazard-suited men arrives on the scene . Meanwhile , FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully have been assigned to other projects since the closure of the X-Files . They are helping investigate a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas . Mulder inspects a building across the street from the supposed target and discovers the bomb in a vending machine . Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud stays behind to disarm the bomb as Mulder and Scully evacuate the building . Unknown to the agents , Michaud makes no effort to disarm the bomb , which detonates . Returning to Washington , D.C. , Mulder and Scully are chastised because , in addition to Michaud , five people were apparently still in the building during the bombing . There are scheduled separate hearings at which their job performances will be evaluated . That evening , Mulder encounters a paranoid doctor , Alvin Kurtzweil , who explains that the victims were the firefighters and boy , that they were already dead , and that the bomb was allowed to detonate in order to destroy evidence of how they died . At the hospital morgue , Scully is able to examine one of the victims , finding evidence of an alien virus . Meanwhile , Mulder and Scully s enemy , the Cigarette Smoking Man , meets with Dr. Ben Bronschweig in Texas , which they locate one of the firefighters who contains the same alien virus , but with an alien organism residing inside the body ; the Cigarette Smoking Man orders to administer a vaccine to it , but should it fail , have the body burned . Later , the alien organism gestates and kills Bronschweig . Mulder and Scully travel to the crime scene in Texas . They come across a strange train hauling tanker trucks and they follow it to a large cornfield surrounding two glowing domes . They enter the domes , only to find them empty . Suddenly , grates leading to an underground area open in the floor and a swarm of bees chases the agents out into the cornfield . Black helicopters appear and begin to chase them , but they escape and head back to Washington .

Maurya has lost her husband , and five of her sons to the sea . As the play begins Nora and Cathleen receive word from the priest that a body , that may be their brother Michael , has washed up on shore in Donegal , the island farthest north of their home island of Inishmaan . Bartley is planning to sail to Connemara to sell a horse , and ignores Maurya s pleas to stay . He leaves gracefully . Maurya predicts that by nightfall she will have no living sons , and her daughters chide her for sending Bartley off with an ill word . Maurya goes after Bartley to bless his voyage , and Nora and Cathleen receive clothing from the drowned corpse that confirms it is their brother . Maurya returns home claiming to have seen the ghost of Michael riding behind Bartley and begins lamenting the loss of the men in her family to the sea , after which some villagers bring in the corpse of Bartley , who has fallen off his horse into the sea and drowned . This speech of Maurya s is famous in Irish drama : ( raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the people around her ) They re all gone now , and there is n't anything more the sea can do to me ... . I ll have no call now to be up crying and praying when the wind breaks from the south , and you can hear the surf is in the east , and the surf is in the west , making a great stir with the two noises , and they hitting one on the other . I ll have no call now to be going down and getting Holy Water in the dark nights after Samhain , and I wo n't care what way the sea is when the other women will be keening . ( To Nora ) Give me the Holy Water , Nora ; there s a small sup still on the dresser .

After centuries of various restrictions , hostilities and frequent pogroms , the Jews of Europe have been reduced to living in Ghettos . The higher class is forced to deal with angry mobs and so experiences a great deal of discomfort ; the lower class lives in despair . Middle-class professionals are distrusted , and the statement do n't buy from Jews causes much anxiety among Jewish people . It is reasonable to assume that the Jews will not be left in peace . Neither a change in the feelings of non-Jews nor a movement to merge into the surrounds of Europe offers much hope to the Jewish people : The Jewish question persists wherever Jews live in appreciable numbers . Wherever it does not exist , it is brought in together with Jewish immigrants . We are naturally drawn into those places where we are not persecuted , and our appearance there gives rise to persecution . This is the case , and will inevitably be so , everywhere , even in highly civilised countriessee , for instance , Franceso long as the Jewish question is not solved on the political level . The book concludes : Therefore I believe that a wondrous generation of Jews will spring into existence . The Maccabeans will rise again . Let me repeat once more my opening words : The Jews who wish for a State will have it . We shall live at last as free men on our own soil , and die peacefully in our own homes . The world will be freed by our liberty , enriched by our wealth , magnified by our greatness . And whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare , will react powerfully and beneficially for the good of humanity . Herzl opposed the efforts already made by Zionist groups to settle Jews in Ottoman-controlled Palestine by arguing that important experiments in colonization have been made , though on the mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of Jews . An infiltration is bound to end badly . It continues till the inevitable moment when the native population feels itself threatened , and forces the government to stop a further influx of Jews . Immigration is consequently futile unless we have the sovereign right to continue such immigration . ( Quoted from The Jewish State , translated by Sylvie dAvigdor , Nutt , London , 1896 , and reprinted by Dover , 1988 , p . 95 . ) For that reason , Herzl , both in Der Judenstaat , and in his political activity on behalf of Zionism , concentrated his efforts on securing official legal sanction from the Ottoman authorities .

The action of Orlando Furioso takes place against the background of the war between the Christian emperor Charlemagne and the Saracen King of Africa , Agramante , who has invaded Europe to avenge the death of his father Traiano . Agramante and his allies  who include Marsilio , the King of Spain , and the boastful warrior Rodomonte  besiege Charlemagne in Paris . Meanwhile , Orlando , Charlemagne s most famous paladin , has been tempted to forget his duty to protect the emperor through his love for the pagan princess Angelica . At the beginning of the poem , Angelica escapes from the castle of the Bavarian Duke Namo , and Orlando sets off in pursuit . The two meet with various adventures until Angelica saves a wounded Saracen knight , Medoro , falls in love , and elopes with him to Cathay . When Orlando learns the truth , he goes mad with despair and rampages through Europe and Africa destroying everything in his path . The English knight Astolfo journeys to Ethiopia on the hippogriff to find a cure for Orlando s madness . He flies up in Elijah s flaming chariot to the moon , where everything lost on earth is to be found , including Orlando s wits . He brings them back in a bottle and makes Orlando sniff them , thus restoring him to sanity . ( At the same time Orlando falls out of love with Angelica , as the author explains that love is itself a form of insanity . ) Orlando joins with Brandimart and Oliver to fight Agramante , Sobrino and Gradasso on the island of Lampedusa . There Orlando kills King Agramante . Another important plotline involves the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero . They too have to endure many vicissitudes . Ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress Alcina and has to be freed from her magic island . He also has to avoid the enchantments of his foster father , the wizard Atlante , who does not want him to fight . Finally , Ruggiero converts to Christianity and marries Bradamante . Rodomonte appears at the wedding feast and accuses him of being a traitor to the Saracen cause , and the poem ends with Ruggiero slaying Rodomonte in single combat . Ruggiero and Bradamante are the ancestors of the House of Este , Ariosto s patrons , whose genealogy he gives at length in canto 3 of the poem . The epic contains many other characters , including Orlando s cousin , the paladin Rinaldo , who is also in love with Angelica ; the thief Brunello ; the Saracen Ferra ; Sacripante , King of Circassia and a leading Saracen knight ; and the tragic heroine Isabella .

At the beginning of the poem , Angelica escapes from the castle of the Bavarian Duke Namo , and Orlando sets off in pursuit . The two meet with various adventures until Angelica saves a wounded Saracen knight , Medoro , falls in love , and elopes with him to Cathay . When Orlando learns the truth , he goes mad with despair and rampages through Europe and Africa destroying everything in his path . The English knight Astolfo journeys to Ethiopia on the hippogriff to find a cure for Orlando s madness . He flies up in Elijah s flaming chariot to the moon , where everything lost on earth is to be found , including Orlando s wits . He brings them back in a bottle and makes Orlando sniff them , thus restoring him to sanity . ( At the same time Orlando falls out of love with Angelica , as the author explains that love is itself a form of insanity . ) Orlando joins with Brandimart and Oliver to fight Agramante , Sobrino and Gradasso on the island of Lampedusa . There Orlando kills King Agramante . Another important plotline involves the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero . They too have to endure many vicissitudes . Ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress Alcina and has to be freed from her magic island . He also has to avoid the enchantments of his foster father , the wizard Atlante , who does not want him to fight . Finally , Ruggiero converts to Christianity and marries Bradamante . Rodomonte appears at the wedding feast and accuses him of being a traitor to the Saracen cause , and the poem ends with Ruggiero slaying Rodomonte in single combat . Ruggiero and Bradamante are the ancestors of the House of Este , Ariosto s patrons , whose genealogy he gives at length in canto 3 of the poem . The epic contains many other characters , including Orlando s cousin , the paladin Rinaldo , who is also in love with Angelica ; the thief Brunello ; the Saracen Ferra ; Sacripante , King of Circassia and a leading Saracen knight ; and the tragic heroine Isabella .

U.S. Navy SEAL Lieutenant Shane Wolfe is assigned to rescue Howard Plummer , a man working on a top-secret government project , from a group of Serbian rebels . Wolfe and his team manage to get Plummer off an enemy boat but are shot while boarding the escape helicopter . Plummer is killed in the attack , and Wolfe spends two months in the hospital . Wolfe s commanding officer , Captain Bill Fawcett , is assigned to escort Plummer s widow , Julie , to Zrich , where a safety deposit box belonging to the Plummers has been discovered . Wolfe is assigned to stay at the Plummer residence , in Bethesda , Maryland to search for the secret project called GHOST , as well as look after the family s five children : Zoe , Seth , Lulu , Peter , and Baby Tyler . The kids prove to be difficult to handle , even with the help of nanny Helga , who finally quits when one of Zoe and Seth s pranks intended for Wolfe goes wrong . A few days later , the school s vice principal , Duane Murney , informs Wolfe that Seth has cut and bleached his hair , has a Nazi armband in his locker , and has skipped every wrestling practice for the past month . At home , a furious Seth tells Wolfe that he only joined the wrestling team because his father wanted him to . He sneaks out of the house , tricking the alarm system with a refrigerator magnet . Wolfe leaves Zoe in charge and follows him to the town theater , where he learns that Seth has secretly joined an amateur production of The Sound of Music . The director quits when he believes the show will be a failure . Wolfe volunteers to take his place , and juggles this task with taking care of the house , giving Zoe driving lessons , and teaching Lulu and the Firefly Scouts martial arts to defend themselves against the rival boy scout troop . Seth quits the wrestling team , and Wolfe challenges Murney to a wrestling match in front of the entire school and easily wins despite Murney s show of bluster . The training Wolfe gives the Firefly Scouts becomes useful when they once again have a conflict with the thuggish scouts . Zoe and Wolfe share stories of their fathers , both of whom died in similar circumstances . They are interrupted by a phone call from Julie , who has figured out the password ( My Angel ) , retrieved the item in a box ( a special key ) , and is on her way home . The kids immediately begin to plan a Welcome Home ' party . That evening , Wolfe discovers a secret vault underneath the garage , which requires a key to open . When Fawcett and Julie arrive home , Fawcett and Wolfe go to the garage , where Wolfe says he is rethinking his career . Two ninjas arrive armed and pull off their masks , revealing themselves as the Plummers ' North Korean neighbors , the Chuns . Fawcett suddenly knocks out Wolfe , revealing himself to be a double agent . Mr. Chun restrains and guards the children while Fawcett and Mrs. Chun take Julie down to the vault . They manage to open the door , but a dangerous security system prevents them from going any farther . The children manage to escape and awaken Wolfe , who sends the kids to get the police while he goes to the vault to help Julie . Mr. Chun follows them in his car ; with Zoe at the wheel , the kids force him to crash . Wolfe figures out how to get past the security system , using a dance ( The Peter Panda Dance ) Howard had used to make Peter go to sleep each night . Julie knocks out Mrs. Chun , and Wolfe s voice activates the final vault , knocking out Fawcett with the door . By then , the children have lured a large crowd of police to the house . Mr. Chun arrives and holds all of them at gunpoint . Wolfe notices school principal and love interest Claire Fletcher ( Lauren Graham ) right behind him , having followed the chase when she saw it pass by the school . Wolfe distracts Mr. Chun with the aide of Gary the duck , and Claire knocks him unconscious . With the mission accomplished and Fawcett and the Chuns arrested , Wolfe and the Plummers say their goodbyes , and Wolfe and Claire share a kiss . At Seth s performance , it is revealed that Wolfe decided to retire from the Navy and join the school staff as the new wrestling coach . Murney also performs in the play , singing Climb Ev'ry Mountain off-key while dressed in a nun s habit .

U.S. Navy SEAL Lieutenant Shane Wolfe is assigned to rescue Howard Plummer , a man working on a top-secret government project , from a group of Serbian rebels . Wolfe and his team manage to get Plummer off an enemy boat but are shot while boarding the escape helicopter . Plummer is killed in the attack , and Wolfe spends two months in the hospital . Wolfe s commanding officer , Captain Bill Fawcett , is assigned to escort Plummer s widow , Julie , to Zrich , where a safety deposit box belonging to the Plummers has been discovered . Wolfe is assigned to stay at the Plummer residence , in Bethesda , Maryland to search for the secret project called GHOST , as well as look after the family s five children : Zoe , Seth , Lulu , Peter , and Baby Tyler . The kids prove to be difficult to handle , even with the help of nanny Helga , who finally quits when one of Zoe and Seth s pranks intended for Wolfe goes wrong . A few days later , the school s vice principal , Duane Murney , informs Wolfe that Seth has cut and bleached his hair , has a Nazi armband in his locker , and has skipped every wrestling practice for the past month . At home , a furious Seth tells Wolfe that he only joined the wrestling team because his father wanted him to . He sneaks out of the house , tricking the alarm system with a refrigerator magnet . Wolfe leaves Zoe in charge and follows him to the town theater , where he learns that Seth has secretly joined an amateur production of The Sound of Music . The director quits when he believes the show will be a failure . Wolfe volunteers to take his place , and juggles this task with taking care of the house , giving Zoe driving lessons , and teaching Lulu and the Firefly Scouts martial arts to defend themselves against the rival boy scout troop . Seth quits the wrestling team , and Wolfe challenges Murney to a wrestling match in front of the entire school and easily wins despite Murney s show of bluster . The training Wolfe gives the Firefly Scouts becomes useful when they once again have a conflict with the thuggish scouts . Zoe and Wolfe share stories of their fathers , both of whom died in similar circumstances . They are interrupted by a phone call from Julie , who has figured out the password ( My Angel ) , retrieved the item in a box ( a special key ) , and is on her way home . The kids immediately begin to plan a Welcome Home ' party . That evening , Wolfe discovers a secret vault underneath the garage , which requires a key to open . When Fawcett and Julie arrive home , Fawcett and Wolfe go to the garage , where Wolfe says he is rethinking his career . Two ninjas arrive armed and pull off their masks , revealing themselves as the Plummers ' North Korean neighbors , the Chuns . Fawcett suddenly knocks out Wolfe , revealing himself to be a double agent . Mr. Chun restrains and guards the children while Fawcett and Mrs. Chun take Julie down to the vault .

Melvin Udall ( Jack Nicholson ) is a 60 year old misanthrope who works at home as a best-selling novelist in New York City working on his 62nd book . He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which , paired with his misanthropy , alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts . He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck , and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs . He takes an interest in his waitress , Carol Connelly ( Helen Hunt ) , the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior . One day , Melvin s apartment neighbor , a gay artist named Simon Bishop ( Greg Kinnear ) , is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery . Melvin is intimidated by Simon s agent , Frank Sachs ( Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) , into caring for Simon s dog , Verdell , while Simon is hospitalized . Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog , Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it . He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol . When Simon is released from the hospital , Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog . Melvin s life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn so she can care for her acutely asthmatic son Spence ( Jesse James ) . Unable to adjust to another waitress , Melvin arranges through his publisher ( Linda Gehringer ) whose husband is a doctor ( Harold Ramis ) to pay for her son s considerable medical expenses as long as Carol agrees to return to work . She is overwhelmed at his generosity , and they agree there will be no physical relationship . Meanwhile , Simon s assault and rehabilitation , coupled with Verdell s preference for Melvin , causes Simon to lose his creative muse . Simon is approaching bankruptcy due to his medical bills . Frank convinces him to go to Baltimore to ask his estranged parents for money . Because Frank is too busy to take the injured Simon to Baltimore himself , Melvin reluctantly agrees to do so ; Frank lends Melvin the use of his Saab 900 convertible for the trip . Melvin invites Carol to accompany them on the trip to lessen the awkwardness . She reluctantly accepts the invitation , and relationships among the three develop . Once in Baltimore , Carol persuades Melvin to take her out to have dinner . Melvin s comments during the dinner greatly flatterand subsequently upsetCarol , and she abruptly leaves . Upon seeing the frustrated Carol , Simon begins to sketch her semi-nude in his hotel room and rekindles his creativity , once more feeling a desire to paint . He briefly reconnects with his parents , but is able to tell them that he ll be fine . After returning to New York , Carol tells Melvin that she does not want him in her life anymore . She later regrets her statement and calls him to apologize . The relationship between Melvin and Carol remains complicated until Simon ( who Melvin has allowed to move in with him until he can fully heal from his injuries and get a new apartment ) convinces Melvin to declare his love for her . Melvin goes to see Carol , who is hesitant , but agrees to try and establish a relationship with him . The film ends with Melvin and Carol walking together . As he opens a door at an early morning pastry shop for Carol , he realizes that he has stepped on a crack in the pavement .

Melvin Udall ( Jack Nicholson ) is a 60 year old misanthrope who works at home as a best-selling novelist in New York City working on his 62nd book . He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which , paired with his misanthropy , alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts . He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck , and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs . He takes an interest in his waitress , Carol Connelly ( Helen Hunt ) , the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior . One day , Melvin s apartment neighbor , a gay artist named Simon Bishop ( Greg Kinnear ) , is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery . Melvin is intimidated by Simon s agent , Frank Sachs ( Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) , into caring for Simon s dog , Verdell , while Simon is hospitalized . Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog , Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it . He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol . When Simon is released from the hospital , Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog . Melvin s life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn so she can care for her acutely asthmatic son Spence ( Jesse James ) . Unable to adjust to another waitress , Melvin arranges through his publisher ( Linda Gehringer ) whose husband is a doctor ( Harold Ramis ) to pay for her son s considerable medical expenses as long as Carol agrees to return to work . She is overwhelmed at his generosity , and they agree there will be no physical relationship . Meanwhile , Simon s assault and rehabilitation , coupled with Verdell s preference for Melvin , causes Simon to lose his creative muse . Simon is approaching bankruptcy due to his medical bills . Frank convinces him to go to Baltimore to ask his estranged parents for money . Because Frank is too busy to take the injured Simon to Baltimore himself , Melvin reluctantly agrees to do so ; Frank lends Melvin the use of his Saab 900 convertible for the trip . Melvin invites Carol to accompany them on the trip to lessen the awkwardness . She reluctantly accepts the invitation , and relationships among the three develop . Once in Baltimore , Carol persuades Melvin to take her out to have dinner . Melvin s comments during the dinner greatly flatterand subsequently upsetCarol , and she abruptly leaves . Upon seeing the frustrated Carol , Simon begins to sketch her semi-nude in his hotel room and rekindles his creativity , once more feeling a desire to paint . He briefly reconnects with his parents , but is able to tell them that he ll be fine . After returning to New York , Carol tells Melvin that she does not want him in her life anymore .

The story opens in England during the First World War at Styles Court , an Essex country manor . Upon her husband s death , the wealthy widow Emily Cavendish inherited a life estate in Styles as well as the outright inheritance of the larger part of the late Mr. Cavendish s income . Mrs. Cavendish became Mrs. Inglethorp upon her recent marriage to a younger man , Alfred Inglethorp . Emily s two stepsons , John and Lawrence Cavendish , John s wife Mary and Cynthia Murdoch , also live at Styles . John Cavendish is the vested remainderman of Styles ; that is , the property will pass to him upon his stepmother s death , per his late father s will . Lawrence Cavendish would also come into a considerable sum of money . The income left to Mrs Inglethorp by her late husband would be distributed according to her will , which she changes at least once per year . If she has not changed her will since her marriage , her husband will inherit that income . Cynthia does war-time work at the pharmacy in the nearby hospital . The residents of Styles wake to find Emily Inglethorp dying of strychnine poisoning . Hastings , a house guest , enlists the help of his friend Hercule Poirot , who is staying in the nearby village , Styles St. Mary . Poirot pieces together events surrounding the murder . On the day she was killed , Emily Inglethorp was overheard arguing with someone , either her husband Alfred or her stepson John . Afterwards , she seemed quite distressed and , apparently , made a new will  which no one can find . She ate little at dinner and retired early to her room with her document case . The case was later forced open by someone and a document removed . Alfred Inglethorp left Styles earlier in the evening and stayed overnight in the nearby village , so was not present when the poisoning occurred . Nobody can explain how or when the strychnine was administered to Mrs. Inglethorp . At first , Alfred is the prime suspect . He has the most to gain financially from his wife s death , and , since he is much younger than Emily was , the Cavendishes already suspect him as a fortune hunter . Evelyn Howard , Emily s companion , seems to hate him . His behaviour is suspicious ; he openly purchased strychnine in the village before Emily was poisoned , and although he denies it , he refuses to provide an alibi . Inspector Japp is keen to arrest him , but Poirot intervenes by proving he could not have purchased the poison . Inspector Japp arrests John Cavendish . He inherits under the terms of her will , and there is evidence to suggest he had obtained poison . Poirot clears Cavendish by proving it was Alfred Inglethorp who committed the crime , assisted by Evelyn Howard , who turns out to be his kissing cousin , not his enemy . The guilty pair poisoned Emily by adding a precipitating agent , bromide ( obtained from Mrs Inglethorp s sleeping powder ) , to her regular evening medicine , causing its normally innocuous strychnine constituents to sink to the bottom of the bottle where they were finally consumed in a single , lethal dose . Their plan had been for Alfred Inglethorp to incriminate himself with false evidence , which could then be refuted at his trial . Once acquitted , due to double jeopardy , he could not be tried for the crime a second time should any genuine evidence against him be subsequently discovered . When he realized that Alfred wanted to be arrested , Poirot prevented it until all the evidence against him was at hand .

He inherits under the terms of her will , and there is evidence to suggest he had obtained poison . Poirot clears Cavendish by proving it was Alfred Inglethorp who committed the crime , assisted by Evelyn Howard , who turns out to be his kissing cousin , not his enemy . The guilty pair poisoned Emily by adding a precipitating agent , bromide ( obtained from Mrs Inglethorp s sleeping powder ) , to her regular evening medicine , causing its normally innocuous strychnine constituents to sink to the bottom of the bottle where they were finally consumed in a single , lethal dose . Their plan had been for Alfred Inglethorp to incriminate himself with false evidence , which could then be refuted at his trial . Once acquitted , due to double jeopardy , he could not be tried for the crime a second time should any genuine evidence against him be subsequently discovered . When he realized that Alfred wanted to be arrested , Poirot prevented it until all the evidence against him was at hand .


The story opens in England during the First World War at Styles Court , an Essex country manor . Upon her husband s death , the wealthy widow Emily Cavendish inherited a life estate in Styles as well as the outright inheritance of the larger part of the late Mr. Cavendish s income . Mrs. Cavendish became Mrs. Inglethorp upon her recent marriage to a younger man , Alfred Inglethorp . Emily s two stepsons , John and Lawrence Cavendish , John s wife Mary and Cynthia Murdoch , also live at Styles . John Cavendish is the vested remainderman of Styles ; that is , the property will pass to him upon his stepmother s death , per his late father s will . Lawrence Cavendish would also come into a considerable sum of money . The income left to Mrs Inglethorp by her late husband would be distributed according to her will , which she changes at least once per year . If she has not changed her will since her marriage , her husband will inherit that income . Cynthia does war-time work at the pharmacy in the nearby hospital . The residents of Styles wake to find Emily Inglethorp dying of strychnine poisoning . Hastings , a house guest , enlists the help of his friend Hercule Poirot , who is staying in the nearby village , Styles St. Mary . Poirot pieces together events surrounding the murder . On the day she was killed , Emily Inglethorp was overheard arguing with someone , either her husband Alfred or her stepson John . Afterwards , she seemed quite distressed and , apparently , made a new will  which no one can find . She ate little at dinner and retired early to her room with her document case . The case was later forced open by someone and a document removed . Alfred Inglethorp left Styles earlier in the evening and stayed overnight in the nearby village , so was not present when the poisoning occurred . Nobody can explain how or when the strychnine was administered to Mrs. Inglethorp . At first , Alfred is the prime suspect . He has the most to gain financially from his wife s death , and , since he is much younger than Emily was , the Cavendishes already suspect him as a fortune hunter . Evelyn Howard , Emily s companion , seems to hate him . His behaviour is suspicious ; he openly purchased strychnine in the village before Emily was poisoned , and although he denies it , he refuses to provide an alibi .

The play begins in Eatonville , Florida , on a Saturday afternoon with Jim and Dave fighting for Daisy s affection . The two men come to blows , and Jim picks up a hock bone from a mule and knocks Dave out . Jim is arrested and held for trial in Joe Clarke s barn . On Monday , the trial begins in the Macedonia Baptist Church . The townspeople are divided along religious lines : Jim s Methodist supporters sit on one side of the church , Dave s Baptist supporters on the other . The issue to be decided at the trial is whether or not Jim has committed a crime . Jim admits he hit Dave but denies it was a crime . Elder Simms argues on Jim s behalf that a weapon is necessary to commit a crime , and nowhere in the Bible does it say a mule bone is a weapon . Elder Childers , representing Dave , says Samson used a donkey s jawbone to kill 3,000 men ( citing Judges 18:18 ) , so the hock bone of a mule must be even more powerful . Joe Clarke declares Jim guilty and banishes him from town for two years . Act III takes place some time later , with Daisy encountering Jim outside of town . She tells him she s been worried about him , but he s skeptical . She demonstrates the sincerity of her affection and Dave comes upon the couple . The two men engage in a war of words to try to show which of them loves Daisy more . The contest ends when it becomes clear that Daisy expects her man to work for the white people who employ her . Jim and Dave are reconciled , and neither remains interested in courting Daisy . The two men return to Eatonville .

Lilly Dillon ( Angelica Huston ) is a veteran con artist . She works for a bookmaker , Bobo Justus ( Pat Hingle ) , making large cash bets at race tracks to lower the odds of longshots . On her way to La Jolla for the horse races , she stops in Los Angeles to visit her son Roy ( John Cusack ) , a small-time grifter whom she has not seen in eight years . She finds him in pain and bleeding internally after one of his victims caught him pulling a petty scam and punched him in the stomach . When medical assistance finally comes , Lilly confronts the doctor , threatening to have him killed if her son dies . At the hospital , Lilly meets and takes an instant dislike to Roy s girlfriend , Myra Langtry ( Annette Bening ) , who is a few years older than her son . Lilly urges her son to quit the grift , saying he literally does not have the stomach for it . Because she leaves late for La Jolla , she misses a race where the winner was paying 701 . For this mistake , Bobo burns her hand with a cigar . Myra , like Roy and Lilly , plays all the angles . When her landlord demands payment of late rent , she uses her sex appeal to lure him into bed and forget the rent . She makes a similar offer to a jeweler ( Stephen Tobolowsky ) to get what she wants for a gem she is trying to pawn . Upon leaving the hospital , Roy takes Myra to La Jolla for the weekend . On the train , she notices him conning a group of sailors in a rigged dice game . Myra reveals to Roy that she is also a grifter and is looking for a new partner for a long-con operation . Myra describes her long association with another man , Cole ( J. T. Walsh ) , and how they took advantage of wealthy marks in business cons , including a greedy oil investor , Gloucester Hebbing ( Charles Napier ) . A flashback scene in a plush office building culminates in a fake FBI raid with a fake shooting of Myra to discourage Hebbing from going to the police . Roy , who insists on working only short-term cons , resists the proposition , fearing she may try to dupe him herself . Myra , seeing Lilly s power over Roy , accuses him of having an incestuous interest in Lilly . Infuriated , Roy strikes her . Myra then plans her revenge . She lets it be known that Lilly has been stealing from Bobo over the years and stashing money in the trunk of her car . Lilly is warned by a friend and flees . Myra follows with the intention of killing her . Roy is called by an FBI agent to identify his mother s body , found in a motel room with the face disfigured by a gunshot wound . While identifying it as Lilly s , he silently notes that there is no cigar burn on the corpse s hand . Coming back home , he finds Lilly trying to steal all of his money . Lilly reveals that she shot Myra in self-defense at the motel and arranged the scene to appear as though Myra s body was actually Lilly s . Roy refuses to let Lilly depart with his money . Lilly pleads with him , then attempts to seduce him , even going so far as to tempt Roy by claiming he is not really her son . Roy rejects her , disgusted . Angered , Lilly swings a suitcase at him and unintentionally breaks a glass he was drinking from into his neck , slashing an artery . Lilly sobs convulsively while she packs up the money as her son bleeds to death on the floor . In the penultimate shot , she is seen dressed in red , riding an elevator that is heading down . Then she gets into Roy s car and drives off into the night .

For this mistake , Bobo burns her hand with a cigar . Myra , like Roy and Lilly , plays all the angles . When her landlord demands payment of late rent , she uses her sex appeal to lure him into bed and forget the rent . She makes a similar offer to a jeweler ( Stephen Tobolowsky ) to get what she wants for a gem she is trying to pawn . Upon leaving the hospital , Roy takes Myra to La Jolla for the weekend . On the train , she notices him conning a group of sailors in a rigged dice game . Myra reveals to Roy that she is also a grifter and is looking for a new partner for a long-con operation . Myra describes her long association with another man , Cole ( J. T. Walsh ) , and how they took advantage of wealthy marks in business cons , including a greedy oil investor , Gloucester Hebbing ( Charles Napier ) . A flashback scene in a plush office building culminates in a fake FBI raid with a fake shooting of Myra to discourage Hebbing from going to the police . Roy , who insists on working only short-term cons , resists the proposition , fearing she may try to dupe him herself . Myra , seeing Lilly s power over Roy , accuses him of having an incestuous interest in Lilly . Infuriated , Roy strikes her . Myra then plans her revenge . She lets it be known that Lilly has been stealing from Bobo over the years and stashing money in the trunk of her car . Lilly is warned by a friend and flees . Myra follows with the intention of killing her . Roy is called by an FBI agent to identify his mother s body , found in a motel room with the face disfigured by a gunshot wound . While identifying it as Lilly s , he silently notes that there is no cigar burn on the corpse s hand . Coming back home , he finds Lilly trying to steal all of his money . Lilly reveals that she shot Myra in self-defense at the motel and arranged the scene to appear as though Myra s body was actually Lilly s . Roy refuses to let Lilly depart with his money . Lilly pleads with him , then attempts to seduce him , even going so far as to tempt Roy by claiming he is not really her son . Roy rejects her , disgusted . Angered , Lilly swings a suitcase at him and unintentionally breaks a glass he was drinking from into his neck , slashing an artery . Lilly sobs convulsively while she packs up the money as her son bleeds to death on the floor . In the penultimate shot , she is seen dressed in red , riding an elevator that is heading down . Then she gets into Roy s car and drives off into the night .


Lilly Dillon ( Angelica Huston ) is a veteran con artist . She works for a bookmaker , Bobo Justus ( Pat Hingle ) , making large cash bets at race tracks to lower the odds of longshots . On her way to La Jolla for the horse races , she stops in Los Angeles to visit her son Roy ( John Cusack ) , a small-time grifter whom she has not seen in eight years . She finds him in pain and bleeding internally after one of his victims caught him pulling a petty scam and punched him in the stomach .

Eight-year-old Princess Irene lives a lonely life in a castle in a wild , desolate , mountainous kingdom , with only her nursemaid , Lootie , for company . Her father , the king , is normally absent , and her mother is dead . Unknown to her , the nearby mines are inhabited by a race of goblins , long banished from the kingdom and now anxious to take revenge on their human neighbors . One rainy day , the princess explores the castle and discovers a beautiful , mysterious lady , who identifies herself as Irene s namesake and great-great-grandmother . The next day , Princess Irene persuades her nursemaid to take her outside . After dark they are chased by goblins and rescued by the young miner , Curdie , whom Irene befriends . At work with the rest of the miners , Curdie overhears the goblins talking , and their conversation reveals to Curdie the secret weakness of goblin anatomy : they have very soft , vulnerable feet . Curdie sneaks into the Great Hall of the goblin palace to eavesdrop on their general meeting , and hears that the goblins intend to flood the mine if a certain other part of their plan should fail . He later conveys this news to his father . In the palace , Princess Irene injures her hand , which her great-great-grandmother heals . A week later Irene is about to see her great-great-grandmother again , but is frightened by a long-legged cat and escapes up the mountain ; whereupon the light from her great-great-grandmother s tower leads her home , where her great-great-grandmother gives Irene a ring attached to a thread invisible except to herself , which thereafter connects her constantly to home . When Curdie explores the goblins ' domain , he is discovered by the goblins and stamps on their feet with great success ; but when he tries to stamp on the Queen s feet she is uninjured due to her stone shoes . The goblins imprison Curdie , thinking he will die of starvation ; but Irene s magic thread leads her to his rescue , and Curdie steals one of the goblin queen s stone shoes . Irene takes Curdie to see her great-great-grandmother and be introduced ; but she is only visible to Irene . Curdie later learns that the goblins are digging a tunnel in the mines towards the king s palace , where they plan to abduct the Princess and marry her to goblin prince Harelip . Curdie warns the palace guards about this , but is imprisoned instead and contracts a fever through a wound in his leg , until Irene s great-great-grandmother heals the wound . Meanwhile , the goblins break through the palace floor and come to abduct the princess ; but Curdie escapes from his prison room and stamps on the goblins ' feet . Upon the goblins ' retreat , Irene is believed a captive ; but Curdie follows the magic thread to her refuge at his own house , and restores her to the king . When the goblins flood the mines , the water enters the palace , and Curdie warns the others ; but the goblins are drowned . The king asks him to serve as a bodyguard ; but Curdie refuses , saying he can not leave his mother and father , and instead accepts a new red petticoat for his mother , as a reward .

One rainy day , the princess explores the castle and discovers a beautiful , mysterious lady , who identifies herself as Irene s namesake and great-great-grandmother . The next day , Princess Irene persuades her nursemaid to take her outside . After dark they are chased by goblins and rescued by the young miner , Curdie , whom Irene befriends . At work with the rest of the miners , Curdie overhears the goblins talking , and their conversation reveals to Curdie the secret weakness of goblin anatomy : they have very soft , vulnerable feet . Curdie sneaks into the Great Hall of the goblin palace to eavesdrop on their general meeting , and hears that the goblins intend to flood the mine if a certain other part of their plan should fail . He later conveys this news to his father . In the palace , Princess Irene injures her hand , which her great-great-grandmother heals . A week later Irene is about to see her great-great-grandmother again , but is frightened by a long-legged cat and escapes up the mountain ; whereupon the light from her great-great-grandmother s tower leads her home , where her great-great-grandmother gives Irene a ring attached to a thread invisible except to herself , which thereafter connects her constantly to home . When Curdie explores the goblins ' domain , he is discovered by the goblins and stamps on their feet with great success ; but when he tries to stamp on the Queen s feet she is uninjured due to her stone shoes . The goblins imprison Curdie , thinking he will die of starvation ; but Irene s magic thread leads her to his rescue , and Curdie steals one of the goblin queen s stone shoes . Irene takes Curdie to see her great-great-grandmother and be introduced ; but she is only visible to Irene . Curdie later learns that the goblins are digging a tunnel in the mines towards the king s palace , where they plan to abduct the Princess and marry her to goblin prince Harelip . Curdie warns the palace guards about this , but is imprisoned instead and contracts a fever through a wound in his leg , until Irene s great-great-grandmother heals the wound . Meanwhile , the goblins break through the palace floor and come to abduct the princess ; but Curdie escapes from his prison room and stamps on the goblins ' feet . Upon the goblins ' retreat , Irene is believed a captive ; but Curdie follows the magic thread to her refuge at his own house , and restores her to the king . When the goblins flood the mines , the water enters the palace , and Curdie warns the others ; but the goblins are drowned . The king asks him to serve as a bodyguard ; but Curdie refuses , saying he can not leave his mother and father , and instead accepts a new red petticoat for his mother , as a reward .

In 1969 , Dr. Malcolm Sayer ( Robin Williams ) is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the New York City borough of The Bronx . After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 19171928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica , Sayer discovers certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients ' respective catatonic states ; actions such as catching a ball , hearing familiar music , and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds . Leonard Lowe ( Robert De Niro ) proves elusive in this regard , but Sayer soon discovers that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a Ouija board . After attending a lecture at a conference on the subject of the L-Dopa drug and its success with patients suffering from Parkinson s Disease , Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients . A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results : Leonard completely awakens from his catatonic state . This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L-Dopa medication and experience awakenings back to reality . Meanwhile , Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula ( Penelope Ann Miller ) , the daughter of another hospital patient . Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions placed upon him as a patient of the hospital , desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases . He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration . Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated , a number of facial and body tics are starting to manifest , which Leonard has difficulty controlling . While Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients , they soon find that it is a temporary measure . As the first to awaken , Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of awakening . Leonard s tics grow more and more prominent and he starts to shuffle more as he walks , and all of the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them . He soon begins to suffer full body spasms and can hardly move . Leonard puts up well with the pain , and asks Sayer to film him , in hopes that he would someday contribute to research that may eventually help others . Leonard acknowledges what is happening to him and has a last lunch with Paula where he tells her he can not see her anymore . When he is about to leave , Paula dances with him , and for this short period of time his spasms disappear . Leonard and Sayer reconcile their differences , but Leonard returns to his catatonic state soon after . The other patients ' fears are similarly realized as each eventually returns to catatonia no matter how much their L-Dopa dosages are increased . Sayer tells a group of grant donors to the hospital that although the awakening did not last , another kind  one of learning to appreciate and live life  took place . For example , he himself overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello ( Julie Kavner ) to go out for coffee , many months after he had declined a similar proposal from her . The nurses also now treat the catatonic patients with more respect and care , and Paula is shown visiting Leonard . The film ends with Sayer standing over Leonard behind a Ouija board , with his hands on Leonard s hands , which are on the planchette . Let s begin , Sayer says .

Sayer tells a group of grant donors to the hospital that although the awakening did not last , another kind  one of learning to appreciate and live life  took place . For example , he himself overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello ( Julie Kavner ) to go out for coffee , many months after he had declined a similar proposal from her .

The film ends with Sayer standing over Leonard behind a Ouija board , with his hands on Leonard s hands , which are on the planchette . Let s begin , Sayer says .


In 1969 , Dr. Malcolm Sayer ( Robin Williams ) is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the New York City borough of The Bronx . After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 19171928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica , Sayer discovers certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients ' respective catatonic states ; actions such as catching a ball , hearing familiar music , and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds . Leonard Lowe ( Robert De Niro ) proves elusive in this regard , but Sayer soon discovers that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a Ouija board . After attending a lecture at a conference on the subject of the L-Dopa drug and its success with patients suffering from Parkinson s Disease , Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients . A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results : Leonard completely awakens from his catatonic state . This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L-Dopa medication and experience awakenings back to reality . Meanwhile , Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula ( Penelope Ann Miller ) , the daughter of another hospital patient . Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions placed upon him as a patient of the hospital , desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases . He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration . Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated , a number of facial and body tics are starting to manifest , which Leonard has difficulty controlling . While Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients , they soon find that it is a temporary measure . As the first to awaken , Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of awakening . Leonard s tics grow more and more prominent and he starts to shuffle more as he walks , and all of the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them . He soon begins to suffer full body spasms and can hardly move . Leonard puts up well with the pain , and asks Sayer to film him , in hopes that he would someday contribute to research that may eventually help others . Leonard acknowledges what is happening to him and has a last lunch with Paula where he tells her he can not see her anymore . When he is about to leave , Paula dances with him , and for this short period of time his spasms disappear .

In Los Angeles , career-focused lawyer Fletcher Reede ( Carrey ) loves his son Max ( Cooper ) , but his inability to keep his promises and the compulsive lying he engages in for his career often cause problems between them and with his former wife Audrey ( Tierney ) , who has become involved with another man named Jerry ( Elwes ) . In court , Fletcher is willing to exaggerate the stories of his clients , and his current client , the self-centered , money-grabbing Samantha Cole ( Tilly ) has garnered the attention of Mr. Allen , a partner at the law firm in which Fletcher works . If Fletcher wins this case , it will bring his firm a fortune and boost his career . Fletcher calls and lies to Audrey about missing Max s birthday due to work , when he is actually having sex with his boss , Miranda , in order to get a promotion . Dejected , Max makes a birthday wish that for one day his father can not tell a lie . The wish immediately comes true , and Fletcher accidentally tells Miranda he has had better after they have sex . The following day , Fletcher immediately realizes that he is unable to do anything dishonest . He can not lie , mislead , or even deceive by withholding a true answer , often uncontrollably blurting out offensive and painful truths that anger his co-workers , and his car ends up in an impound for several parking violations . This comes to a head when he realizes that he is unable to even ask questions when he knows the answer will be a lie , which is inconvenient as Samantha and her alleged affair partner Kenneth Faulk are willing to commit perjury to win the high profile case and he can not ask him the questions they have been given answers for . Realizing that Max had wished for this to happen , Fletcher tries to convince him that adults need to lie , but can not give any type of answer at why he should continue to lie to his son . Fletcher also figures out that since Max wished for him to tell the truth for only one day , he tries to do what he can to delay Samantha s case since the magic wish will expire at 8:15 p.m. , 24 hours after Max made the wish . Things only get worse for Fletcher as he loses his loyal assistant Greta after admitting he had lied about the miserly reasons for denying her pay raises and the expensive gifts he gave her , and Audrey tells Fletcher that she and Max are moving to Boston with Jerry in order to prevent any more heartbreaks from Fletcher s broken promises . Fletcher s erratic behavior in court leads to several questions of his sanity as he objects to himself and badgers and provokes his own witnesses into admitting they had an affair against Samantha and her husband s prenuptial agreement . He even goes so far as to beat himself up and claim that someone attacked him in order to try and avoid the case , but when asked if he feels like he can continue , he ca n't deny it and he says yes . During the case , Fletcher finds a technicality that Samantha lied that she was underage when she signed the prenup prior to her marriage , rendering it void and entitling her to half of Mr. Cole s estate , allowing him to win the case truthfully . But when Samantha decides to contest full custody of their children , who Mr. Cole dearly loves , just because she wants more money from the child support payments , Fletcher regrets mentioning the technicality after seeing Mrs. Cole pull the children out of their father s arms , and shriek her demands for more money . Realizing now that winning the case has punished the loving husband and rewarded the cheating wife , Fletcher has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the Judge demanding that he reverse the decision , but he is arrested for contempt of court . He calls Audrey from the prison s phone and pleads with her to bail him out and give him another chance , but she hangs up on him . Greta returns and bails Fletcher from jail , who forgives him and realizes that telling the truth has made him a better man and he rushes to the airport to stop Audrey and Max from leaving forever . He misses their flight , but he sneaks onto the tarmac by hiding in a piece of luggage , steals a motorized staircase , and manages to gain the pilot s attention by throwing his shoe at the cockpit window , forcing him to abort the flight . However , Fletcher s victory is cut short when he crashes into a barrier and is sent flying into a baggage tug , which causes a chain reaction that leaves Fletcher unconscious and with both of his legs broken . After waking up , he tells Max how much he cares about him and how sorry he was for breaking his promises . Despite no longer being under the wish s influence , Fletcher means what he says and adds that Max is his priority , and Max convinces Audrey to stay in Los Angeles . One year later , Fletcher is healed and is running his own law firm with Greta as his continued assistant . Max makes a wish with his birthday cake and the lights come on to reveal Fletcher and Audrey kissing , but explains he wished for rollerblades instead of them reconciling . Fletcher clutches his hands into The Claw -a game he likes to play with Max by chasing him - and chases him and Audrey around the house with it .

He even goes so far as to beat himself up and claim that someone attacked him in order to try and avoid the case , but when asked if he feels like he can continue , he ca n't deny it and he says yes . During the case , Fletcher finds a technicality that Samantha lied that she was underage when she signed the prenup prior to her marriage , rendering it void and entitling her to half of Mr. Cole s estate , allowing him to win the case truthfully . But when Samantha decides to contest full custody of their children , who Mr. Cole dearly loves , just because she wants more money from the child support payments , Fletcher regrets mentioning the technicality after seeing Mrs. Cole pull the children out of their father s arms , and shriek her demands for more money . Realizing now that winning the case has punished the loving husband and rewarded the cheating wife , Fletcher has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the Judge demanding that he reverse the decision , but he is arrested for contempt of court . He calls Audrey from the prison s phone and pleads with her to bail him out and give him another chance , but she hangs up on him . Greta returns and bails Fletcher from jail , who forgives him and realizes that telling the truth has made him a better man and he rushes to the airport to stop Audrey and Max from leaving forever . He misses their flight , but he sneaks onto the tarmac by hiding in a piece of luggage , steals a motorized staircase , and manages to gain the pilot s attention by throwing his shoe at the cockpit window , forcing him to abort the flight . However , Fletcher s victory is cut short when he crashes into a barrier and is sent flying into a baggage tug , which causes a chain reaction that leaves Fletcher unconscious and with both of his legs broken . After waking up , he tells Max how much he cares about him and how sorry he was for breaking his promises . Despite no longer being under the wish s influence , Fletcher means what he says and adds that Max is his priority , and Max convinces Audrey to stay in Los Angeles . One year later , Fletcher is healed and is running his own law firm with Greta as his continued assistant . Max makes a wish with his birthday cake and the lights come on to reveal Fletcher and Audrey kissing , but explains he wished for rollerblades instead of them reconciling . Fletcher clutches his hands into The Claw -a game he likes to play with Max by chasing him - and chases him and Audrey around the house with it .


In Los Angeles , career-focused lawyer Fletcher Reede ( Carrey ) loves his son Max ( Cooper ) , but his inability to keep his promises and the compulsive lying he engages in for his career often cause problems between them and with his former wife Audrey ( Tierney ) , who has become involved with another man named Jerry ( Elwes ) . In court , Fletcher is willing to exaggerate the stories of his clients , and his current client , the self-centered , money-grabbing Samantha Cole ( Tilly ) has garnered the attention of Mr. Allen , a partner at the law firm in which Fletcher works . If Fletcher wins this case , it will bring his firm a fortune and boost his career . Fletcher calls and lies to Audrey about missing Max s birthday due to work , when he is actually having sex with his boss , Miranda , in order to get a promotion . Dejected , Max makes a birthday wish that for one day his father can not tell a lie . The wish immediately comes true , and Fletcher accidentally tells Miranda he has had better after they have sex . The following day , Fletcher immediately realizes that he is unable to do anything dishonest . He can not lie , mislead , or even deceive by withholding a true answer , often uncontrollably blurting out offensive and painful truths that anger his co-workers , and his car ends up in an impound for several parking violations . This comes to a head when he realizes that he is unable to even ask questions when he knows the answer will be a lie , which is inconvenient as Samantha and her alleged affair partner Kenneth Faulk are willing to commit perjury to win the high profile case and he can not ask him the questions they have been given answers for . Realizing that Max had wished for this to happen , Fletcher tries to convince him that adults need to lie , but can not give any type of answer at why he should continue to lie to his son . Fletcher also figures out that since Max wished for him to tell the truth for only one day , he tries to do what he can to delay Samantha s case since the magic wish will expire at 8:15 p.m. , 24 hours after Max made the wish . Things only get worse for Fletcher as he loses his loyal assistant Greta after admitting he had lied about the miserly reasons for denying her pay raises and the expensive gifts he gave her , and Audrey tells Fletcher that she and Max are moving to Boston with Jerry in order to prevent any more heartbreaks from Fletcher s broken promises .

Dr. Horace Bianchon discovers near the town of Vendme an abandoned manor : La Grande Bretche . Intrigued by the ruins , the doctor tries unsuccessfully to enter the house night after night . Upon returning to the inn where he is staying , he questions the locals about the house . Finally several locals , including a lawyer and the innkeeper , explain the story of the manor . Madame de Merret , the late owner of the manor , forbid anyone from entering the house upon her death , be it workmen , visitors , or government officials , for 50 years . The lawyer was given the task , as well as funds , to ensure that her dying wish be accomplished . Dr. Bianchon learned that Madame de Merret had a Spanish lover for a short period of her life . One day , Madame de Merret s husband returned early from a business trip when her lover was at the house . The lover hid himself in the closet , but the husband , hearing a sound , confronted his wife about the noise . Pressured by her suspicious husband , Madame de Merret swore upon a crucifix that there was no one in the closet , but threatened in turn to leave her husband if he were ever to open the closet out of suspicion . In response , Monsieur de Merret sent for a mason to wall up the closet , trapping the lover inside . Terrified , Madame de Merret passed along a message to the mason asking him to break a hole in the door when her husband was not looking before completely walling the closet off . The mason does that , and Madame de Merret catches a final glimpse of the maddened eyes of her lover through the hole . Once the closet was walled up completely , Madame and Monsieur de Merret stay in the bedroom for several days , listening to the muffled noise coming from the closet . Because of this traumatic experience , Madame de Merret declared her house off-limits upon her death .

The book tells the story of the quest for Captain Grant of the Britannia . After finding a bottle the captain had cast into the ocean after the Britannia is shipwrecked , Lord and Lady Glenarvan of Scotland contact Mary and Robert , the young daughter and son of Captain Grant , through an announcement in a newspaper . The government refuses to launch a rescue expedition , but Lord and Lady Glenarvan , moved by the children s condition , decide to do it by themselves . The main difficulty is that the coordinates of the wreckage are mostly erased , and only the latitude ( 37 degrees ) is known ; thus , the expedition would have to circumnavigate the 37th parallel south . The bottle was retrieved from a shark s stomach , so it is impossible to trace its origin by the currents . Remaining clues consist of a few words in three languages . They are re-interpreted several times throughout the novel to make various destinations seem likely . Lord Glenarvan makes it his quest to find Grant ; together with his wife , Grant s children and the crew of his yacht , the Duncan , they set off for South America . An unexpected passenger in the form of French geographer Jacques Paganel ( he missed his steamer to India by accidentally boarding on the Duncan ) joins the search . They explore Patagonia , Tristan da Cunha Island , Amsterdam Island , and Australia ( a pretext to describe the flora , fauna , and geography of numerous places to the targeted audience ) . There , they find a former quarter-master of the Britannia , Ayrton , who proposes to lead them to the site of the wreckage . However , Ayrton is a traitor , who was not present during the loss of the Britannia , but was abandoned in Australia after a failed attempt to seize control of the ship to practice piracy . He tries to take control of the Duncan , but by sheer luck , this attempt also fails . However the Glenarvans , the Grant children , Paganel and some sailors are left in Australia , and mistakenly believing that the Duncan is lost , they sail to Auckland , New Zealand , from where they want to come back to Europe . When their ship is wrecked south of Auckland on the New Zealand coast , they are captured by a Mori tribe , but luckily manage to escape and board a ship that they discover , to their astonishment , to be the Duncan . Ayrton , made a prisoner , offers to trade his knowledge of Captain Grant in exchange for being abandoned on a desert island instead of being surrendered to the British authorities . The Duncan sets sail for the Tabor Island , which , by sheer luck , turns out to be Captain Grant s shelter . They leave Ayrton in his place to live among the beasts and regain his humanity . Ayrton reappears in Verne s later novel , L'le mystrieuse ( The Mysterious Island , 1874 ) .


The book tells the story of the quest for Captain Grant of the Britannia . After finding a bottle the captain had cast into the ocean after the Britannia is shipwrecked , Lord and Lady Glenarvan of Scotland contact Mary and Robert , the young daughter and son of Captain Grant , through an announcement in a newspaper . The government refuses to launch a rescue expedition , but Lord and Lady Glenarvan , moved by the children s condition , decide to do it by themselves . The main difficulty is that the coordinates of the wreckage are mostly erased , and only the latitude ( 37 degrees ) is known ; thus , the expedition would have to circumnavigate the 37th parallel south . The bottle was retrieved from a shark s stomach , so it is impossible to trace its origin by the currents . Remaining clues consist of a few words in three languages . They are re-interpreted several times throughout the novel to make various destinations seem likely . Lord Glenarvan makes it his quest to find Grant ; together with his wife , Grant s children and the crew of his yacht , the Duncan , they set off for South America . An unexpected passenger in the form of French geographer Jacques Paganel ( he missed his steamer to India by accidentally boarding on the Duncan ) joins the search . They explore Patagonia , Tristan da Cunha Island , Amsterdam Island , and Australia ( a pretext to describe the flora , fauna , and geography of numerous places to the targeted audience ) . There , they find a former quarter-master of the Britannia , Ayrton , who proposes to lead them to the site of the wreckage . However , Ayrton is a traitor , who was not present during the loss of the Britannia , but was abandoned in Australia after a failed attempt to seize control of the ship to practice piracy . He tries to take control of the Duncan , but by sheer luck , this attempt also fails . However the Glenarvans , the Grant children , Paganel and some sailors are left in Australia , and mistakenly believing that the Duncan is lost , they sail to Auckland , New Zealand , from where they want to come back to Europe .

While seeking water for his cattle Travis Fox enters a little known canyon in the Arizona desert and gets captured by three men , one of whom he recognizes as Dr. Gordon Ashe , an archaeologist . After discovering that Fox studied archaeology and had done some digging in the very canyon they now occupy , the men have him cleared through security and offer to make him part of their team . Then Ashe tells him that he will be joining an expedition 10,000 years into the past to look for a spaceship . Disguised as Folsom hunters , Fox , Ashe , and Ross Murdock travel into the past to scout out the area around the wreckage of an alien starship , a sphere perhaps 120 feet in diameter . They find the wreck near a lake and then , across a ridge , they find a smaller spaceship intact , its crew of Baldies dead . After receiving the scouts report via transtemporal telegraph , Major Kelgarries , the projects director , and several technicians come into the past and examine the small ship , determining that they can shift it directly into the present . Fox , Ashe , and Murdock serve as roving sentries in the area around the smaller globeship as technicians build a time transfer cage around it . The ash from a volcanic explosion and a stampede of mammoths drive the three men into the ship with Case Renfry , an electronics technician , on the day the transfer is to be made . An earthquake triggers the transfer , bringing the ship into the present , and then the ships preset autopilot , jolted into action , takes the ship into space . After carrying the men through hyperspace , the ship lands on a planet where faltering robots refuel the ship . Another leap through hyperspace brings the ship to the second planet of an alien solar system . The ship lands in a desert , sits for a couple of days , and then blasts off on a course that takes it to the systems Earth-like third planet . Upon landing the ship indicates that the voyage has ended by ejecting a small discus from its autopilot . Renfry attempts to understand the autopilot and to rewind the course tape while the three time agents explore the jungle-draped ruins of a once-great city , in which theyve landed . After several weeks Renfry believes that he has succeeded and he attempts to launch the ship . The ship runs its course in reverse , pausing on the desert planet and the refueling station , and brings the four men back to Earth , landing on the very spot from which they had blasted off .

The play contains a prologue in which the character Machiavel , a Senecan ghost based on Niccol Machiavelli , introduces the tragedy of a Jew . Machiavel expresses the cynical view that power is amoral , saying I count religion but a childish toy , /And hold there is no sin but ignorance . The Jewish merchant in question , Barabas , is introduced as a man owning more wealth than all of Malta . When Turkish ships arrive to demand tribute , however , Barabas s wealth is seized and he is left penniless . Incensed , he begins a campaign to engineer the downfall of the Maltese governor who robbed him . With the aid of his daughter , Abigail , he recovers some of his former assets and buys a Turkish slave , Ithamore , who appears to hate Christians as much as Barabas does . Barabas then , in revenge for the robbery , uses his daughter s beauty to embitter the governor s son ( Lodowick ) and his friend ( Mathias ) against each other , leading to a duel in which they both die . When Abigail learns of Barabas s role in the plot , she consigns herself to a nunnery , only to be poisoned ( along with all of the nuns ) by Barabas and Ithamore for becoming a Christian . The two go on to kill a couple of friars who threaten to divulge their previous crimes . Ithamore himself , however , is lured by a beautiful prostitute and her criminal friend into disclosing his secrets and blackmailing Barabas . Barabas poisons all of them in revenge , but not before the governor is apprised of his deeds . Barabas escapes execution by feigning death , and then helps an advancing Turkish army to sack Malta , for which he is awarded governorship of the city . He then turns on the Turks , allowing the Knights of Malta to kill the Turkish army . The Maltese , however , turn on Barabas and kill him as they regain control of Malta .

The play contains a prologue in which the character Machiavel , a Senecan ghost based on Niccol Machiavelli , introduces the tragedy of a Jew . Machiavel expresses the cynical view that power is amoral , saying I count religion but a childish toy , /And hold there is no sin but ignorance . The Jewish merchant in question , Barabas , is introduced as a man owning more wealth than all of Malta . When Turkish ships arrive to demand tribute , however , Barabas s wealth is seized and he is left penniless . Incensed , he begins a campaign to engineer the downfall of the Maltese governor who robbed him . With the aid of his daughter , Abigail , he recovers some of his former assets and buys a Turkish slave , Ithamore , who appears to hate Christians as much as Barabas does . Barabas then , in revenge for the robbery , uses his daughter s beauty to embitter the governor s son ( Lodowick ) and his friend ( Mathias ) against each other , leading to a duel in which they both die . When Abigail learns of Barabas s role in the plot , she consigns herself to a nunnery , only to be poisoned ( along with all of the nuns ) by Barabas and Ithamore for becoming a Christian . The two go on to kill a couple of friars who threaten to divulge their previous crimes . Ithamore himself , however , is lured by a beautiful prostitute and her criminal friend into disclosing his secrets and blackmailing Barabas .

Steven Jay Russell is on his deathbed , recalling the events of his life that led him to this point . He spent his early adult years in Virginia Beach as a police officer . He plays the organ at church , has unenthusiastic sex with his wife , Debbie , and spends his off-hours searching for his biological mother , who had placed him for adoption as a child . Steven locates his biological mother , but she rejects him . He then quits the police force and moves to Texas and works for Sysco , the family business . After a car crash on the way to a homosexual tryst , Steven leaves his family and life behind , though he keeps in touch with his wife and young daughter , and explores the world as his true self  a gay man . He moves to Miami , where he finds a boyfriend , Jimmy , and they adopt a luxurious lifestyle . To keep themselves in the style to which they have become accustomed , Steven becomes a con man . Steven is pursued by the police , and , after jumping off a parking garage , is sent to prison , where he falls in love with inmate Phillip Morris . Steven can not bear to be separated from Phillip . After being released , he helps get Phillip freed from prison by posing as a lawyer , then attains wealth by fraudulently acquiring a position as Chief Financial Officer of a large medical management company called USAMM . Steven eventually is caught embezzling . While in the police car he reminisces about Jimmy in Florida dying of AIDS . He asks the police for Phillips insulin and injects himself . He goes back to prison , Phillip is also sent to prison as an accomplice and angrily tells Steven he never wants to see him again . Months later , Phillip learns from another inmate that Steven is dying of AIDS .

Several thousand years ago , the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war by the two Transformer factions , the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron . Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark , a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet , into space , but Megatron pursued it . Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze , and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky . Witwicky activated Megatrons navigational system , which scanned the AllSparks coordinates into his glasses . The glasses end up in the possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky . In the present , Sam buys his first car , a rusting Chevrolet Camaro , but discovers it has a life of its own . In modern Qatar , Blackout attacks and destroys a United States military base in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark . A team of soldiers led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert , pursued by Blackouts drone Scorponok . They fight Scorponok off , aided by aerial reinforcements and travel home with Scorponoks stinger , discovering sabot rounds damaged the armor . At the Pentagon , Secretary of Defense John Keller leads the investigation into the attack . Sound analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon , Frenzy , hacking into the network while onboard Air Force One . While the hack is thwarted , Frenzy downloads files on Archibalds glasses , tracking down Sam with Barricade , disguised as a police car . Sam and his high school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued by the Camaro who turns out to be Autobot scout Bumblebee , but he is mute and has to communicate through his car radio . Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots , Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals  Optimus , Jazz , Ironhide , and Ratchet . Optimus explains the details of their situation , revealing if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earths machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind . Sam , Mikaela , and the Autobots travel to Sams house to retrieve the glasses , but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven , a top secret government branch led by Seymour Simmons . The Autobots stop the agents , but Simmons calls for backup , who take Sam , Mikaela , and Bumblebee into custody with Optimus obtaining the glasses . The respective groups connected to the Transformers are gathered together at Hoover Dam by Sector Sevens director Tom Banachek . Inside , the group discover the frozen Megatron and the AllSpark , but Frenzy , who smuggled away in Mikaelas bag , summons the other Decepticons to attack . Bumblebee is released to protect the AllSpark , shrinking it down to a handheld size so it can be transported to safety . Megatron escapes the dam after thawing out . A lengthy battle occurs in Mission City ( but was clearly filmed in Los Angeles ) , with most of the Decepticons being killed , but Megatron murders Jazz . He prevents Sams attempted escape with the AllSpark , and begins to fight Optimus . After a long brawl Megatron seems to get the upper hand . Optimus then tells Sam to push the cube into his chest , but Sam rams it into Megatron s chest instead , extinguishing his spark . Starscream is the only Decepticon to escape , but Barricade remains on Earth . Optimus salvages a shard of the AllSpark from Megatrons body . The United States government shuts down Sector Seven , disposing of the dead Decepticons in the Laurentian Abyss . Sam and Mikaela then start a relationship while the Autobots secretly hide out on Earth , Optimus sends a transmission into space inviting any surviving Autobots to join them .

Several thousand years ago , the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war by the two Transformer factions , the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron . Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark , a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet , into space , but Megatron pursued it . Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze , and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky . Witwicky activated Megatrons navigational system , which scanned the AllSparks coordinates into his glasses . The glasses end up in the possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky . In the present , Sam buys his first car , a rusting Chevrolet Camaro , but discovers it has a life of its own . In modern Qatar , Blackout attacks and destroys a United States military base in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark . A team of soldiers led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert , pursued by Blackouts drone Scorponok . They fight Scorponok off , aided by aerial reinforcements and travel home with Scorponoks stinger , discovering sabot rounds damaged the armor . At the Pentagon , Secretary of Defense John Keller leads the investigation into the attack . Sound analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon , Frenzy , hacking into the network while onboard Air Force One . While the hack is thwarted , Frenzy downloads files on Archibalds glasses , tracking down Sam with Barricade , disguised as a police car . Sam and his high school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued by the Camaro who turns out to be Autobot scout Bumblebee , but he is mute and has to communicate through his car radio . Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots , Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals  Optimus , Jazz , Ironhide , and Ratchet . Optimus explains the details of their situation , revealing if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earths machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind . Sam , Mikaela , and the Autobots travel to Sams house to retrieve the glasses , but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven , a top secret government branch led by Seymour Simmons .

Several thousand years ago , the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war by the two Transformer factions , the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron . Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark , a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet , into space , but Megatron pursued it . Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze , and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky . Witwicky activated Megatrons navigational system , which scanned the AllSparks coordinates into his glasses . The glasses end up in the possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky . In the present , Sam buys his first car , a rusting Chevrolet Camaro , but discovers it has a life of its own . In modern Qatar , Blackout attacks and destroys a United States military base in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark . A team of soldiers led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert , pursued by Blackouts drone Scorponok . They fight Scorponok off , aided by aerial reinforcements and travel home with Scorponoks stinger , discovering sabot rounds damaged the armor . At the Pentagon , Secretary of Defense John Keller leads the investigation into the attack . Sound analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon , Frenzy , hacking into the network while onboard Air Force One . While the hack is thwarted , Frenzy downloads files on Archibalds glasses , tracking down Sam with Barricade , disguised as a police car . Sam and his high school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued by the Camaro who turns out to be Autobot scout Bumblebee , but he is mute and has to communicate through his car radio . Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots , Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals  Optimus , Jazz , Ironhide , and Ratchet . Optimus explains the details of their situation , revealing if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earths machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind . Sam , Mikaela , and the Autobots travel to Sams house to retrieve the glasses , but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven , a top secret government branch led by Seymour Simmons . The Autobots stop the agents , but Simmons calls for backup , who take Sam , Mikaela , and Bumblebee into custody with Optimus obtaining the glasses . The respective groups connected to the Transformers are gathered together at Hoover Dam by Sector Sevens director Tom Banachek . Inside , the group discover the frozen Megatron and the AllSpark , but Frenzy , who smuggled away in Mikaelas bag , summons the other Decepticons to attack .

The United States government shuts down Sector Seven , disposing of the dead Decepticons in the Laurentian Abyss . Sam and Mikaela then start a relationship while the Autobots secretly hide out on Earth , Optimus sends a transmission into space inviting any surviving Autobots to join them .


Several thousand years ago , the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war by the two Transformer factions , the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron . Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark , a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet , into space , but Megatron pursued it . Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze , and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky . Witwicky activated Megatrons navigational system , which scanned the AllSparks coordinates into his glasses . The glasses end up in the possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky . In the present , Sam buys his first car , a rusting Chevrolet Camaro , but discovers it has a life of its own . In modern Qatar , Blackout attacks and destroys a United States military base in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark . A team of soldiers led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert , pursued by Blackouts drone Scorponok . They fight Scorponok off , aided by aerial reinforcements and travel home with Scorponoks stinger , discovering sabot rounds damaged the armor . At the Pentagon , Secretary of Defense John Keller leads the investigation into the attack . Sound analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon , Frenzy , hacking into the network while onboard Air Force One . While the hack is thwarted , Frenzy downloads files on Archibalds glasses , tracking down Sam with Barricade , disguised as a police car . Sam and his high school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued by the Camaro who turns out to be Autobot scout Bumblebee , but he is mute and has to communicate through his car radio . Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots , Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals  Optimus , Jazz , Ironhide , and Ratchet . Optimus explains the details of their situation , revealing if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earths machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind . Sam , Mikaela , and the Autobots travel to Sams house to retrieve the glasses , but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven , a top secret government branch led by Seymour Simmons . The Autobots stop the agents , but Simmons calls for backup , who take Sam , Mikaela , and Bumblebee into custody with Optimus obtaining the glasses . The respective groups connected to the Transformers are gathered together at Hoover Dam by Sector Sevens director Tom Banachek . Inside , the group discover the frozen Megatron and the AllSpark , but Frenzy , who smuggled away in Mikaelas bag , summons the other Decepticons to attack . Bumblebee is released to protect the AllSpark , shrinking it down to a handheld size so it can be transported to safety . Megatron escapes the dam after thawing out . A lengthy battle occurs in Mission City ( but was clearly filmed in Los Angeles ) , with most of the Decepticons being killed , but Megatron murders Jazz . He prevents Sams attempted escape with the AllSpark , and begins to fight Optimus . After a long brawl Megatron seems to get the upper hand .

The novel opens with Rebecca s journey to Riverboro , to live with her two aunts , Miranda and Jane Sawyer . Until this time , she has lived on the family farm . Rebecca is the second eldest of seven children . Most of the children have fanciful names , such as Marquis and Jenny Lind , influenced by their father s artistic background ( Rebecca is named after both the heroines in Ivanhoe ) . The family is quite poor , due to the number of children , Mr. Randall s inability to stick to a job , and the farm being mortgaged . At the beginning of the novel , he has been dead for three years and the family is barely scraping by . Rebecca s stay with her aunt is a chance to improve her opportunities in life and to ease the strain on her family s budget , with one less mouth to feed . Despite her impoverished background , Rebecca is imaginative and charming . She often composes little poems and songs to express her feelings or to amuse her younger brothers and sisters . It is she who named their farm Sunnybrook . Miranda and Jane had wanted Hannah , the eldest sister , due to her pragmatic nature and household skills , but her mother needs her at home for the same reason . She sends Rebecca instead . Miranda is unimpressed by Rebecca s imagination and sallow complexion and says she s the image of her shiftless father , Lorenzo DeMedici Randall . Miranda determines to do her duty and train Rebecca to be a proper young lady , so she will not shame the Sawyer name . Jane takes on the role of Rebecca s protector and acts as a buffer between her niece and her sister . Jane teaches Rebecca to sew , cook and manage a household . Rebecca s liveliness and curiosity brighten Jane s life and refresh her spirit . Although Rebecca strives to win Miranda s approval she finds it hard to live up to Miranda s rigid standards . Rebecca is up against Miranda s view of her as all Randall and no Sawyer . The middle of the novel is for the most part a description of life at Riverboro and its inhabitants . Important characters are Jeremiah Cobb and his wife Sarah , who first encounter Rebecca s charm ; Rebecca s schoolfellow and best friend , Emma Jane Perkins ; and Adam Ladd , a young businessman who takes an interest in Rebecca s education . Adam meets Rebecca when she and Emma Jane are selling soap to help a poor family receive a lamp as a premium . Rebecca nicknames him Mr. Aladdin . Rebecca proves to be a good student , especially in English , and goes on to attend high school in Wareham . In the last section of the book Rebecca has become a young lady with the same high spirit and a talent for writing . She applies for a teaching place in Augusta , but her mother falls ill and Rebecca must return to care for her and the farm . While Rebecca is away from Riverboro , Miranda dies and leaves the Sawyer house and land to Rebecca . A railway company will buy Sunnybrook Farm for construction purposes and this gives the Randall family a sufficient living . Thanks to Miranda s will , Rebecca now has enough money to become an independent woman and help her siblings . The novel ends with her exclaiming , God bless Aunt Miranda ! God bless the brick house that was ! God bless the brick house that is to be !

Eighteen-yearold Charity Royall is bored with life in the small town of North Dormer . She is a librarian and ward of North Dormers premier citizen , Lawyer Royall . While working at the library , Charity meets visiting architect Lucius Harney . When Harneys cousin , Miss Hatchard , with whom he is boarding , leaves the village , Harney becomes Mr. Royalls boarder , and Charity his companion while he explores buildings for a book on colonial houses he is preparing . Mr. Royall , who once tried to force his way into Charity s bedroom after his wife s death , and later asked her to marry him , notices their growing closeness . He tries to put a stop to it by telling Harney he can no longer accommodate him in his house . Harney makes it appear as though he has left town , but only moves to a nearby village and continues to communicate with Charity . On a trip to Nettleton , Harney kisses Charity for the first time and buys her a present of a brooch . Afterwards they run into a drunken Mr. Royall , who is accompanied by prostitutes . Mr. Royall verbally abuses Charity , causing her to become overwhelmed with shame . After the trip , Charity and Harney begin a sexual relationship . At a ceremony during North Dormers Old Home Week , Charity sees Harney with Annabel Balch , a society girl whom she envies . Afterwards , Charity goes to the abandoned house where she and Harney usually meet . Mr. Royall unexpectedly shows up and , when Harney arrives , Mr. Royall asks him sarcastically if that is where he intends to live after he marries Charity . After an angry Mr. Royall leaves , Harney promises Charity that he is going to marry her , but that he has to go away for a while first . After Harney has left the town , Charitys friend Ally lets slip that she saw him leave with Annabel Balch , to whom he is engaged to be married . Charity writes a letter to Harney telling him to do the right thing and marry Annabel . Charity has been feeling unwell , so she goes to Dr. Merkle ( a plump woman with small bright eyes , an immense mass of black hair coming down low on her forehead , and unnaturally white and even teeth ) , who confirms her suspicion that she is pregnant . After the examination Dr. Merkle charges five dollars , and Charity , not having enough money to cover it , has to leave the brooch Harney gave her . When she gets home she reads a letter from Harney that makes her realize that , despite his promises , he is unlikely to break his engagement to Miss Balch . Charity decides she can not stay at home and so makes her way to the mountain , intending to look for her mother . On the way she sees the minister , Mr . Miles , and her friend Liff Hyatt . They are on their way to the mountain because Charitys mother is dying . When they arrive , Charitys mother is already dead , and the three of them bury her . Charity stays on the mountain overnight , where she sees the abject poverty and resolves not to raise her child there . She decides that she is going to be a prostitute , and with the money she earns she will hire someone to take care of her child . On the way home she meets Mr. Royall , who has come to pick her up . He offers to marry her . After Charity marries Mr. Royall in Nettleton , she realizes that he knows she is pregnant and has married her only to protect her . He gives her money to buy clothes , but instead she goes to Dr. Merkle to get her brooch back . Dr. Merkle has heard of her marriage to Mr. Royall and demands a large sum for returning the brooch . Rather than paying the money , Charity quickly grabs the brooch and rushes from the office ( in a few editions of the novel , she leaves the money with Merkle ) . Charity writes a last letter to Harney , telling him about her marriage , and finally returns to North Dormer to live with Mr. Royall .

After the examination Dr. Merkle charges five dollars , and Charity , not having enough money to cover it , has to leave the brooch Harney gave her . When she gets home she reads a letter from Harney that makes her realize that , despite his promises , he is unlikely to break his engagement to Miss Balch . Charity decides she can not stay at home and so makes her way to the mountain , intending to look for her mother . On the way she sees the minister , Mr . Miles , and her friend Liff Hyatt . They are on their way to the mountain because Charitys mother is dying . When they arrive , Charitys mother is already dead , and the three of them bury her . Charity stays on the mountain overnight , where she sees the abject poverty and resolves not to raise her child there . She decides that she is going to be a prostitute , and with the money she earns she will hire someone to take care of her child . On the way home she meets Mr. Royall , who has come to pick her up . He offers to marry her . After Charity marries Mr. Royall in Nettleton , she realizes that he knows she is pregnant and has married her only to protect her . He gives her money to buy clothes , but instead she goes to Dr. Merkle to get her brooch back . Dr. Merkle has heard of her marriage to Mr. Royall and demands a large sum for returning the brooch . Rather than paying the money , Charity quickly grabs the brooch and rushes from the office ( in a few editions of the novel , she leaves the money with Merkle ) . Charity writes a last letter to Harney , telling him about her marriage , and finally returns to North Dormer to live with Mr. Royall .


Eight men eat breakfast at a Los Angeles diner before executing their planned diamond heist . Six of them use aliases : Mr. Blonde , Mr. Blue , Mr. Brown , Mr. Orange , Mr . Pink , and Mr. White . The others are mob boss Joe Cabot and his son and underboss , Nice Guy Eddie Cabot , who are responsible for planning the job . After fleeing the scene of the crime , White drives Orange to the rendezvous in one of Joe s warehouses . Orange , having been shot during the escape , is severely bleeding out . Pink arrives in an angry mood ; he believes the job was a setup and that the police were waiting for them . White informs him that Brown is dead and that both Blue and Blonde are missing . He also mentions that Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist . As he and Joe are old friends , White is furious that he would employ such a psychopath . Pink reveals that he has hidden the diamonds nearby , but argues with White over whether or not they should get medical attention for Orange . Blonde arrives and tells the others that Eddie is en route to meet them . He then brings out a kidnapped policeman , Marvin Nash , and has White and Pink beat him for information about who set them up . Eddie arrives and orders them to retrieve the diamonds and ditch the getaway vehicles , leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange . Nash denies knowing anything , but Blonde ignores him and resumes the torture , cutting off his right ear with a straight razor . He then tries to set Nash on fire , but is subsequently shot dead by Orange . Orange explains that he is really an undercover police officer and that the police have been tracking him . When Eddie , Pink , and White return , Orange tries to convince them that Blonde planned to kill them and steal the diamonds for himself . After finishing off Nash , Eddie accuses him of lying , since Blonde was loyal to his father . Joe then arrives with news that the police have found and killed Blue . Having found proof of Orange s true loyalties , he moves to execute him , but White intervenes and holds him at gunpoint . Eddie in turn points his own weapon at White , creating a Mexican standoff . The three shoot ; both Cabots are killed , and White and Orange are mortally wounded . Spooked , Pink takes the diamonds and flees . As White cradles the dying Orange in his arms , the latter confesses the truth . Without saying a word , White aims his last bullet at Orange s head . The police storm the warehouse and order White to drop his gun . Gunshots sound and White collapses .

The action covers a period of roughly four monthsfrom August to Novemberaround the time of Queen Victoria s Jubilee . Liza Kemp is an 18-year-old factory worker and the youngest of a large family , now living alone with her aging mother . Very popular with all the residents of Vere Street , Lambeth , she likes Tom , a boy her age , but not as much as he likes her , so she rejects him when he proposes . Nevertheless , she is persuaded to join a party of 32 who make a coach trip ( in a horse-drawn coach , of course ) to a nearby village on the August Bank Holiday Monday . Some of the other members of the party are Tom ; Liza s friend Sally and her boyfriend Harry ; and Jim Blakeston , a 40-year-old father of 5 who has recently moved to Vere Street with his large family , and his wife ( while their eldest daughter , Polly , is taking care of her siblings ) . The outing is fun , and they all get drunk on beer . On their way back in the dark , Liza realises that Jim Blakeston is making a pass at her by holding her hand . Back home , Jim manages to speak to her alone and to steal a kiss from her . Seemingly without considering either the moral implications or the consequences of her actions , Liza feels attracted to Jim . They never appear together in public because they do not want the other residents of Vere Street or their workmates to start talking about them . One of Jim Blakeston s first steps to win Liza s heart is to go to a melodramatic play with her on Saturday night . Afterwards , he succeeds in seducing her ( although the graphic details of their sexual encounter are not explicitly described ) : Liza , ' he said a whisper , will yer ? ' Will I wot ? ' she said , looking down . You know , Liza . Sy , will yer ? ' Na , ' she said . But in the end they do slide down into the darkness of the passage . ( The reader never learns whether at that time Liza is still a virgin or not . ) Liza is overwhelmed by love . ( Thus began a time of love and joy . ) When autumn arrives and the nights get chillier , Liza s secret meetings with Jim become less comfortable and more trying ; they must meet in the third-class waiting-room of Waterloo station . To Liza s dismay , people do start talking about them despite their precautions . Only Liza s mother , a drunkard and a simple person , does n't know about their affair . After Liza s friend Sally gets married , her husband does n't want her to earn her own money , so he stops her from working at the factory ; besides , Sally soon becomes pregnant . With Sally married and stuck at home , and even Tom seemingly shunning her , Liza feels increasingly isolated , but her love for Jim keeps her going . They do talk about their love affair : about the possibility of Jim leaving his wife and children ( I dunno if I could get on without the kids ) ; about Liza not being able to leave her mother , who needs her help ; about living somewhere else as if we was married , about bigamybut , strangely , not about adultery . The novel builds up to a sad climax , suggesting that all menwith the possible exception of Tomare alike , since they all beat their wives , especially when they have been drinking . Soon after their wedding , Harry beats up Sally just because she has been away from home chatting with a female neighbor ; he even hits his mother-in-law . When Liza drops by , she stays a bit longer to comfort Sally , which makes her late for her meeting with Jim in front of a nearby pub . When she finally gets there , Jim is aggressive towards her for being late . Without really intending to , he hits her across the face ( It was n't the blow that urt me much ; it was the wy you was talkin ' ) and gives her a black eye . Soon the situation deteriorates completely . Mrs Blakeston , who is pregnant again , opposes Jim s affair with Liza by refusing to talk to him , then goes around telling other people what she would do with Liza if she caught her , and those people inform Liza , who is frightened because she is weak and she knows Mrs. Blakeston is strong . One Saturday afternoon in November , Liza is on her way home from work when the angry Mrs. Blakeston confronts her , spits in her face , and physically attacks her . Quickly a crowd gathers , not to abate the fight , but to abet it . ( The audience shouted and cheered and clapped their hands . ) Eventually , both Tom and Jim stop the fight , and Tom walks Liza home . Liza is now publicly stigmatised as a wrong one , a fact she herself admits to Tom ( Oh , but I ave treated yer bad . I m a regular wrong un , I am ) . Despite all her misbehaviour ( I could n't elp it ! [ ... ] I did love im so ! ) , Tom still wants to marry Liza , but she tells him that it s too lite now because she thinks she is pregnant . Tom says he would n't mind that , but she insists on refusing . Meanwhile , at the Blakestones ' , Jim beats up his wife . Other residents hear them and young Polly appeals to some for help , but they choose not to interfere in other people s domestic problems ( She ll git over it ; an ' p'raps she deserves it , for all you know ) . When Mrs Kemp comes home and sees her daughter s injuries , all she does is offer her some alcohol ( whiskey or gin ) . That evening they both get drunk , despite Liza s pregnancy . During the next night Liza has a miscarriage . Mr Hodges , who lives upstairs , fetches a doctor from the nearby hospital , who soon says he can do nothing for her . While her daughter is dying , Mrs Kemp has a long talk with Mrs Hodges , a midwife and sick-nurse . Liza s last visitor is Jim , but Liza is already in a coma . Mrs Kemp and Mrs Hodges are talking about the funeral arrangements when they hear Liza s death rattle and the doctor declares her dead .

Afterwards , he succeeds in seducing her ( although the graphic details of their sexual encounter are not explicitly described ) : Liza , ' he said a whisper , will yer ? ' Will I wot ?

With Sally married and stuck at home , and even Tom seemingly shunning her , Liza feels increasingly isolated , but her love for Jim keeps her going . They do talk about their love affair : about the possibility of Jim leaving his wife and children ( I dunno if I could get on without the kids ) ; about Liza not being able to leave her mother , who needs her help ; about living somewhere else as if we was married , about bigamybut , strangely , not about adultery . The novel builds up to a sad climax , suggesting that all menwith the possible exception of Tomare alike , since they all beat their wives , especially when they have been drinking . Soon after their wedding , Harry beats up Sally just because she has been away from home chatting with a female neighbor ; he even hits his mother-in-law . When Liza drops by , she stays a bit longer to comfort Sally , which makes her late for her meeting with Jim in front of a nearby pub .

Soon the situation deteriorates completely . Mrs Blakeston , who is pregnant again , opposes Jim s affair with Liza by refusing to talk to him , then goes around telling other people what she would do with Liza if she caught her , and those people inform Liza , who is frightened because she is weak and she knows Mrs. Blakeston is strong . One Saturday afternoon in November , Liza is on her way home from work when the angry Mrs. Blakeston confronts her , spits in her face , and physically attacks her . Quickly a crowd gathers , not to abate the fight , but to abet it . ( The audience shouted and cheered and clapped their hands . ) Eventually , both Tom and Jim stop the fight , and Tom walks Liza home . Liza is now publicly stigmatised as a wrong one , a fact she herself admits to Tom ( Oh , but I ave treated yer bad . I m a regular wrong un , I am ) . Despite all her misbehaviour ( I could n't elp it ! [ ... ] I did love im so ! ) , Tom still wants to marry Liza , but she tells him that it s too lite now because she thinks she is pregnant . Tom says he would n't mind that , but she insists on refusing . Meanwhile , at the Blakestones ' , Jim beats up his wife .

Mrs Kemp and Mrs Hodges are talking about the funeral arrangements when they hear Liza s death rattle and the doctor declares her dead .


The action covers a period of roughly four monthsfrom August to Novemberaround the time of Queen Victoria s Jubilee . Liza Kemp is an 18-year-old factory worker and the youngest of a large family , now living alone with her aging mother . Very popular with all the residents of Vere Street , Lambeth , she likes Tom , a boy her age , but not as much as he likes her , so she rejects him when he proposes . Nevertheless , she is persuaded to join a party of 32 who make a coach trip ( in a horse-drawn coach , of course ) to a nearby village on the August Bank Holiday Monday . Some of the other members of the party are Tom ; Liza s friend Sally and her boyfriend Harry ; and Jim Blakeston , a 40-year-old father of 5 who has recently moved to Vere Street with his large family , and his wife ( while their eldest daughter , Polly , is taking care of her siblings ) . The outing is fun , and they all get drunk on beer . On their way back in the dark , Liza realises that Jim Blakeston is making a pass at her by holding her hand . Back home , Jim manages to speak to her alone and to steal a kiss from her . Seemingly without considering either the moral implications or the consequences of her actions , Liza feels attracted to Jim .

Mrs Kemp and Mrs Hodges are talking about the funeral arrangements when they hear Liza s death rattle and the doctor declares her dead .


The action covers a period of roughly four monthsfrom August to Novemberaround the time of Queen Victoria s Jubilee . Liza Kemp is an 18-year-old factory worker and the youngest of a large family , now living alone with her aging mother . Very popular with all the residents of Vere Street , Lambeth , she likes Tom , a boy her age , but not as much as he likes her , so she rejects him when he proposes . Nevertheless , she is persuaded to join a party of 32 who make a coach trip ( in a horse-drawn coach , of course ) to a nearby village on the August Bank Holiday Monday . Some of the other members of the party are Tom ; Liza s friend Sally and her boyfriend Harry ; and Jim Blakeston , a 40-year-old father of 5 who has recently moved to Vere Street with his large family , and his wife ( while their eldest daughter , Polly , is taking care of her siblings ) . The outing is fun , and they all get drunk on beer . On their way back in the dark , Liza realises that Jim Blakeston is making a pass at her by holding her hand . Back home , Jim manages to speak to her alone and to steal a kiss from her . Seemingly without considering either the moral implications or the consequences of her actions , Liza feels attracted to Jim . They never appear together in public because they do not want the other residents of Vere Street or their workmates to start talking about them . One of Jim Blakeston s first steps to win Liza s heart is to go to a melodramatic play with her on Saturday night . Afterwards , he succeeds in seducing her ( although the graphic details of their sexual encounter are not explicitly described ) : Liza , ' he said a whisper , will yer ? ' Will I wot ? ' she said , looking down . You know , Liza . Sy , will yer ? ' Na , ' she said . But in the end they do slide down into the darkness of the passage .

The play opens during a dinner party at the home of Sir Robert Chiltern in London s fashionable Grosvenor Square . Sir Robert , a prestigious member of the House of Commons , and his wife , Lady Chiltern , are hosting a gathering that includes his friend Lord Goring , a dandified bachelor and close friend to the Chilterns , Mabel Chiltern , and other genteel guests . During the party , Mrs. Cheveley , an enemy of Lady Chiltern s from their school days , attempts to blackmail Sir Robert into supporting a fraudulent scheme to build a canal in Argentina . Apparently , Mrs. Cheveley s dead mentor and lover , Baron Arnheim , convinced the young Sir Robert to sell him a Cabinet secret , a secret that suggested he buy stocks in the Suez Canal three days before the British government announced its purchase . Sir Robert made his fortune with that illicit money , and Mrs. Cheveley has the letter to prove his crime . Fearing the ruin of both career and marriage , Sir Robert submits to her demands . When Mrs. Cheveley pointedly informs Lady Chiltern of Sir Robert s change of heart regarding the canal scheme , the morally inflexible Lady Chiltern , unaware of both her husband s past and the blackmail plot , insists that Sir Robert renege on his promise . For Lady Chiltern , their marriage is predicated on her having an ideal husband that is , a model spouse in both private and public life that she can worship : thus Sir Robert must remain unimpeachable in all his decisions . Sir Robert complies with the lady s wishes and apparently seals his doom . Also toward the end of Act I , Mabel and Lord Goring come upon a diamond brooch that Lord Goring gave someone many years ago . Goring takes the brooch and asks that Mabel inform him if anyone comes to retrieve it . In the second act , which also takes place at Sir Robert s house , Lord Goring urges Sir Robert to fight Mrs. Cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife . He also reveals that he and Mrs. Cheveley were formerly engaged . After finishing his conversation with Sir Robert , Goring engages in flirtatious banter with Mabel . He also takes Lady Chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be less morally inflexible and more forgiving . Once Goring leaves , Mrs. Cheveley appears , unexpected , in search of a brooch she lost the previous evening . Incensed at Sir Robert s reneging on his promise , she ultimately exposes Sir Robert to his wife once they are both in the room . Unable to accept a Sir Robert now unmasked , Lady Chiltern then denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him . In the third act , set in Lord Goring s home , Goring receives a pink letter from Lady Chiltern asking for his help , a letter that might be read as a compromising love note . Just as Goring receives this note , however , his father , Lord Caversham , drops in and demands to know when his son will marry . A visit from Sir Robert , who seeks further counsel from Goring , follows . Meanwhile , Mrs. Cheveley arrives unexpectedly and , misrecognized by the butler as the woman Goring awaits , is ushered into Lord Goring s drawing room . While she waits , she finds Lady Chiltern s letter . Ultimately , Sir Robert discovers Mrs. Cheveley in the drawing room and , convinced of an affair between these two former lovers , angrily storms out of the house . When she and Lord Goring confront each other , Mrs. Cheveley makes a proposal . Claiming to still love Goring from their early days of courtship , she offers to exchange Sir Robert s letter for her old beau s hand in marriage . Lord Goring declines , accusing her of defiling love by reducing courtship to a vulgar transaction and ruining the Chilterns ' marriage . He then springs his trap . Removing the diamond brooch from his desk drawer , he binds it to Cheveley s wrist with a hidden device . Goring then reveals how the item came into her possession . Apparently Mrs. Cheveley stole it from his cousin , Mary Berkshire , years ago . To avoid arrest , Cheveley must trade the incriminating letter for her release from the bejewelled handcuff . After Goring obtains and burns the letter , however , Mrs. Cheveley steals Lady Chiltern s note from his desk . Vengefully she plans to send it to Sir Robert misconstrued as a love letter addressed to the dandified lord . Mrs. Cheveley exits the house in triumph . The final act , which returns to Grosvenor Square , resolves the many plot complications sketched above with a decidedly happy ending . Lord Goring proposes to and is accepted by Mabel . Lord Caversham informs his son that Sir Robert has denounced the Argentine canal scheme before the House . Lady Chiltern then appears , and Lord Goring informs her that Sir Robert s letter has been destroyed but that Mrs. Cheveley has stolen her letter and plans to use it to destroy her marriage . At that moment , Sir Robert enters while reading Lady Chiltern s letter , but as the letter does not have the name of the addressee , he assumes it is meant for him , and reads it as a letter of forgiveness . The two reconcile . Lady Chiltern initially agrees to support Sir Robert s decision to renounce his career in politics , but Lord Goring dissuades her from allowing her husband to resign . When Sir Robert refuses Lord Goring his sister s hand in marriage , still believing he has taken up with Mrs. Cheveley , Lady Chiltern is forced to explain last night s events and the true nature of the letter . Sir Robert relents , and Lord Goring and Mabel are permitted to wed .

Apparently Mrs. Cheveley stole it from his cousin , Mary Berkshire , years ago . To avoid arrest , Cheveley must trade the incriminating letter for her release from the bejewelled handcuff . After Goring obtains and burns the letter , however , Mrs. Cheveley steals Lady Chiltern s note from his desk . Vengefully she plans to send it to Sir Robert misconstrued as a love letter addressed to the dandified lord . Mrs. Cheveley exits the house in triumph . The final act , which returns to Grosvenor Square , resolves the many plot complications sketched above with a decidedly happy ending . Lord Goring proposes to and is accepted by Mabel . Lord Caversham informs his son that Sir Robert has denounced the Argentine canal scheme before the House . Lady Chiltern then appears , and Lord Goring informs her that Sir Robert s letter has been destroyed but that Mrs. Cheveley has stolen her letter and plans to use it to destroy her marriage . At that moment , Sir Robert enters while reading Lady Chiltern s letter , but as the letter does not have the name of the addressee , he assumes it is meant for him , and reads it as a letter of forgiveness . The two reconcile . Lady Chiltern initially agrees to support Sir Robert s decision to renounce his career in politics , but Lord Goring dissuades her from allowing her husband to resign . When Sir Robert refuses Lord Goring his sister s hand in marriage , still believing he has taken up with Mrs. Cheveley , Lady Chiltern is forced to explain last night s events and the true nature of the letter . Sir Robert relents , and Lord Goring and Mabel are permitted to wed .


The play opens during a dinner party at the home of Sir Robert Chiltern in London s fashionable Grosvenor Square . Sir Robert , a prestigious member of the House of Commons , and his wife , Lady Chiltern , are hosting a gathering that includes his friend Lord Goring , a dandified bachelor and close friend to the Chilterns , Mabel Chiltern , and other genteel guests . During the party , Mrs. Cheveley , an enemy of Lady Chiltern s from their school days , attempts to blackmail Sir Robert into supporting a fraudulent scheme to build a canal in Argentina . Apparently , Mrs. Cheveley s dead mentor and lover , Baron Arnheim , convinced the young Sir Robert to sell him a Cabinet secret , a secret that suggested he buy stocks in the Suez Canal three days before the British government announced its purchase . Sir Robert made his fortune with that illicit money , and Mrs. Cheveley has the letter to prove his crime . Fearing the ruin of both career and marriage , Sir Robert submits to her demands . When Mrs. Cheveley pointedly informs Lady Chiltern of Sir Robert s change of heart regarding the canal scheme , the morally inflexible Lady Chiltern , unaware of both her husband s past and the blackmail plot , insists that Sir Robert renege on his promise . For Lady Chiltern , their marriage is predicated on her having an ideal husband that is , a model spouse in both private and public life that she can worship : thus Sir Robert must remain unimpeachable in all his decisions . Sir Robert complies with the lady s wishes and apparently seals his doom . Also toward the end of Act I , Mabel and Lord Goring come upon a diamond brooch that Lord Goring gave someone many years ago . Goring takes the brooch and asks that Mabel inform him if anyone comes to retrieve it . In the second act , which also takes place at Sir Robert s house , Lord Goring urges Sir Robert to fight Mrs. Cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife . He also reveals that he and Mrs. Cheveley were formerly engaged . After finishing his conversation with Sir Robert , Goring engages in flirtatious banter with Mabel . He also takes Lady Chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be less morally inflexible and more forgiving . Once Goring leaves , Mrs. Cheveley appears , unexpected , in search of a brooch she lost the previous evening . Incensed at Sir Robert s reneging on his promise , she ultimately exposes Sir Robert to his wife once they are both in the room . Unable to accept a Sir Robert now unmasked , Lady Chiltern then denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him . In the third act , set in Lord Goring s home , Goring receives a pink letter from Lady Chiltern asking for his help , a letter that might be read as a compromising love note . Just as Goring receives this note , however , his father , Lord Caversham , drops in and demands to know when his son will marry . A visit from Sir Robert , who seeks further counsel from Goring , follows . Meanwhile , Mrs. Cheveley arrives unexpectedly and , misrecognized by the butler as the woman Goring awaits , is ushered into Lord Goring s drawing room . While she waits , she finds Lady Chiltern s letter . Ultimately , Sir Robert discovers Mrs. Cheveley in the drawing room and , convinced of an affair between these two former lovers , angrily storms out of the house . When she and Lord Goring confront each other , Mrs. Cheveley makes a proposal . Claiming to still love Goring from their early days of courtship , she offers to exchange Sir Robert s letter for her old beau s hand in marriage . Lord Goring declines , accusing her of defiling love by reducing courtship to a vulgar transaction and ruining the Chilterns ' marriage . He then springs his trap .

Frank Saltram is a man who apparently has a towering intellect , but one that manifests itself only in sparkling table-talk . He has a real and power gift to delight with his conversation , particularly when intoxicated , but other than conversation he produces nothing . Saltram also recognises no obligations or duties , is ungrateful and utterly unreliable , and is apparently prone to immoral acts . He lives off others , particularly the Mulvilles , who , convinced of Saltram s genius and genuinely enjoying his talk , host him for months at a time . In the opinion of the unnamed narrator , Saltram is not a deliberate conman ; he simply suffers from a want of dignity . The story revolves around Saltram and a group of people who are fascinated by him . Ruth Anvoy , a young American woman with a wealthy father , comes to Britain to visit her widowed aunt Lady Coxon . There she meets George Gravener , a man with a real intellect and a future in politics , and the two become engaged . She also meets Saltram , and is fascinated and impressed by his talk and intellect , though aware that he has shortcomings of character . Having made a promise to her now-deceased husband , Lady Coxon has for years been seeking to bestow a sum of 13,000 pounds upon a talented intellectual whose potential has been hampered by lack of money . Having failed to find such a person , Lady Coxon tells Anvoy that upon her death the money will be left to her , and she must carry on the quest . Anvoy s father suffers heavy financial losses and loses most of what he has . He dies , and shortly afterwards Lady Coxon dies . Anvoy , having lost nearly all her wealth , has only the 13,000 pounds from Lady Coxon , with a moral but not legal obligation to give it away . Gravener urges her to keep the money , as it could be used to buy them a house once they are married . She refuses , and their relationship becomes strained . Later , she entertains the idea of giving the money to Saltram , who Gravener despises as a fraud and not a gentleman . Eventually their engagement is broken off . Finally , the unnamed narrator is given a sealed letter and asked to give it to Anvoy . The letter is understood to contain a denunciation of Saltram s most immoral acts . The narrator must decide whether to blight Saltram s prospects by delivering the letter . He is willing to do so if it will save his friend Gravener s engagement with Anvoy , but Gravener is unable to assure him of this . Eventually he does offer the letter to Anvoy , but Anvoy declines to read it . She awards the Coxon Fund to Saltram , who lives off it exactly as he lived off his friends , producing nothing of intellectual value . Thus the only result of the award is the Mulvilles and others lose the pleasure of Saltram s conversation .

Two teenagers , Masami ( Hitomi Sat ) and Tomoko ( Yko Takeuchi ) , talk about a videotape recorded by a boy in Izu which is fabled to bear a curse that kills the viewer seven days after watching . Tomoko reveals that a week ago , she and three of her friends watched a weird tape and received a call after watching . Tomoko is killed by an unseen force as Masami watches , horrified . Days later , Reiko Asakawa ( Nanako Matsushima ) , a reporter investigating the popularity of the video curse , discovers that her niece Tomoko , and her three other friends , mysteriously died at the same time , on the same night , with their faces twisted in fear . She also discovers that Masami became insane and is in a mental hospital . After stumbling upon Tomoko s photos from the past week , Reiko finds that the four teenagers stayed in a rental cabin in Izu . Reiko goes to Izu and arrives at the rented cabin , where she finds an unlabeled tape in the reception room of the teenagers ' rental cottage . Watching the tape , Reiko sees a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images . As soon as the tape is over , Reiko sees a mysterious reflection in the television and receives a phone call , with an unknown voice telling her seven days . Disturbed , she leaves the cabin . Reiko enlists the help of her ex-husband , Ryji Takayama ( Hiroyuki Sanada ) . They take a picture of Reiko and find her face blurred in the photograph . Ryji then watches the tape , against Reiko s objections . A day later , Reiko creates a copy for Ryji for them to study . They find a hidden message embedded within the tape saying frolic in brine , goblins be thine . The message is in a form of dialect from Izu shima Island . That night , Reiko catches her young son Yoichi watching the videotape ; claiming that Tomoko had told him to do it . Reiko and Ryji sail for shima and discover the history of the great psychic Shizuko Yamamura , who was accused of faking supernatural powers ; and thus committed suicide . With only a day left , Reiko and Ryji discover that the videotape was made psionically by Shizuko s lost daughter , Sadako Yamamura , whose supernatural powers surpassed even those of her mother . The two go back to Izu with the assumption that Sadako is dead and her vengeful spirit ( Onry ) killed the teenagers . They uncover a well underneath the cabin and through a vision see the circumstances of Sadako s murder by her father . They try to find Sadako s body in an attempt to appease her spirit . Minutes before her seven days are up , Reiko finds Sadako s corpse , and they believe that the curse is broken . The next day Ryji is at home and his TV switches on by itself , showing the image of a well . The ghost of Sadako crawls out of the well , out of Ryji s TV set , and frightens him into a state of shock , killing him via cardiac arrest . Before dying , he manages to dial Reiko s number ; she hears his last minutes over the phone and realizes the videotape s curse remains unbroken . Desperate to save her son , Reiko realizes that copying the tape and showing it to someone else saved her . With a VCR and Ryji s copy of the tape , Reiko travels with her son to see her father in an attempt to save him , realizing that this is a never-ending cycle : The tape must always be copied and passed on to ensure the survival of the viewers .

John Girdlestone owns the firm of Girdlestone . It is a very lucrative business and John Girdlestone and his son Ezra Girdlestone are respected by everyone . Both father and son are cynics and have no other thought but for their business ; after giving a donation of 25 for charity , John Girdlestone remarks to himself that it is not a bad investment , as it will make a favorable impression on the collector , who is a Member of Parliament , whose influence he hopes to use some day . Ezra , his son , is even more of a cynic , as the elder Girdlestone s cynicism is mitigated by his supposed religiosity . However , he manifests a great acumen for business , sometimes , even surpassing his father s sharpness in business matters . A series of disastrous speculations by the elder Girdlestone financially ruins the firm . After keeping the impending bankruptcy a secret from everyone for a time , he tells his son ( whom he has fooled with a dummy ledger ) about it , who is disgusted by his father s rashness . They resort to chicanery to save the firm . They plan to send an agent to the Ural mountains who will claim to have found diamond mines . They speculate that the resulting plunge in the prices of diamonds in England and South Africa will force the dealers to get rid of their diamonds quickly at absurdly cheap rates to avoid total financial ruin , which would eventually fall on them if diamonds from the Urals start pouring in the market . They will then step in and buy as many diamonds as their remaining money would allow them . Once their capital is exhausted , their agent will disappear and the discovery that the Ural diamond mines were a hoax would skyrocket the prices of diamonds once again , leaving them rich men . Their plan works perfectly and the prices go down just as they had expected . Ezra Girdlestone travels to South Africa to buy from the dealers there while John Girdlestone starts buying in London . After they spend all their money on diamonds and get ready to call their agent back from the Urals , their plan collapses with the discovery of bona fide diamond mines in South Africa . As a fellow conspirator tells Ezra in South Africa : Russia or no Russia , the prices will not go up ! He goes back to England and both of them sell their diamonds cheaply , which leaves them in an even more precarious situation than they already were in . A very old friend of John Girdlestone had entrusted his daughter to him before dying . She was heir to 40,000 which she would inherit upon coming of age . John Girdlestone persuades his son to seduce the girl and marry her so that they could get their hands on the money . Ezra fails miserably not only because he is totally inept in romance , but because the girl is already in love with another man . Having exhausted all their means , John Girdlestone decides on a sinister plan . His friend s will provides that if the girl dies before coming of age , John Girdlestone becomes the sole heir . He plans to murder the girl . His son does not favour this plan , but his father persuades him , telling him that it will make the firm rich again .


John Girdlestone owns the firm of Girdlestone . It is a very lucrative business and John Girdlestone and his son Ezra Girdlestone are respected by everyone . Both father and son are cynics and have no other thought but for their business ; after giving a donation of 25 for charity , John Girdlestone remarks to himself that it is not a bad investment , as it will make a favorable impression on the collector , who is a Member of Parliament , whose influence he hopes to use some day . Ezra , his son , is even more of a cynic , as the elder Girdlestone s cynicism is mitigated by his supposed religiosity . However , he manifests a great acumen for business , sometimes , even surpassing his father s sharpness in business matters . A series of disastrous speculations by the elder Girdlestone financially ruins the firm . After keeping the impending bankruptcy a secret from everyone for a time , he tells his son ( whom he has fooled with a dummy ledger ) about it , who is disgusted by his father s rashness . They resort to chicanery to save the firm . They plan to send an agent to the Ural mountains who will claim to have found diamond mines . They speculate that the resulting plunge in the prices of diamonds in England and South Africa will force the dealers to get rid of their diamonds quickly at absurdly cheap rates to avoid total financial ruin , which would eventually fall on them if diamonds from the Urals start pouring in the market . They will then step in and buy as many diamonds as their remaining money would allow them . Once their capital is exhausted , their agent will disappear and the discovery that the Ural diamond mines were a hoax would skyrocket the prices of diamonds once again , leaving them rich men . Their plan works perfectly and the prices go down just as they had expected . Ezra Girdlestone travels to South Africa to buy from the dealers there while John Girdlestone starts buying in London . After they spend all their money on diamonds and get ready to call their agent back from the Urals , their plan collapses with the discovery of bona fide diamond mines in South Africa . As a fellow conspirator tells Ezra in South Africa : Russia or no Russia , the prices will not go up ! He goes back to England and both of them sell their diamonds cheaply , which leaves them in an even more precarious situation than they already were in .

Thomas Jerome Newton is a humanoid alien who comes to Earth seeking to construct a spaceship to ferry others from his home planet , Anthea , to Earth . Anthea is experiencing a terrible drought after many nuclear wars , and the population has dwindled to less than 300 . Their own starships are unusable for lack of fuel and 500 years of neglect . The Antheans have no water , an abundance of food that is slowly dwindling , and feeble solar power . Like all Antheans , Newton is super-intelligent , but he has been selected for this mission because he has the physical strength necessary to function in Earth s hotter climate and higher gravity . Arriving at Earth in a lifeboat , Newton first lands in the state of Kentucky . He quickly becomes familiar with the environment and forms a plan . Using advanced technology from his home planet , Newton patents many inventions , and amasses incredible wealth as the head of a technology-based conglomerate . He plans to use this wealth to construct space vehicles for the rest of the Anthean population . Along the way he meets Betty Jo , who falls in love with him . He does not return these feelings , but takes her and his curious fuel-technician Nathan Bryce as his friends , while he runs his company in the shadows . Betty Jo introduces Newton to many Earth customs , such as church , fashion , and alcohol . However , his appetite for alcohol soon leads to problems , as he begins to experience intense emotions unfamiliar to Antheans . Eventually , Newton s alien nature is discovered by Nathan Bryce , and it comes as a relief to Newton to be able to reveal his secret to someone . He expresses the hope that the Antheans he will ferry to Earth will flourish and use their superior intelligence to help Earth achieve peace , prosperity , and safety . However , the CIA arrests Newton , having followed him since his appearance on Earth and having recorded this private conversation with Bryce . They submit him to rigorous tests and analysis , resulting in conclusive evidence of his alien identity , but decide not to release the results for fear they would simply not be believed , and possibly even embarrass the government , which at this point is controlled by the Democratic Party . Newton is released , but is immediately arrested by the FBI , which begins its own examinations . Their final examination is an X-ray of Newton s skull , through his eyes . Newton , whose eyes are sensitive to X-rays , is unable to stop them and is blinded . The story of Newton s blinding becomes a scandal which enables the Republicans to take power , eventually leading to a catastrophe . Newton , speaking to Bryce for the last time , explains bitterly that he is unable to continue his spaceship project because of his blindness and because of planetary alignments which have changed during his captivity . He records a message which he hopes to broadcast via radio to his home planet .

Betty Jo introduces Newton to many Earth customs , such as church , fashion , and alcohol . However , his appetite for alcohol soon leads to problems , as he begins to experience intense emotions unfamiliar to Antheans . Eventually , Newton s alien nature is discovered by Nathan Bryce , and it comes as a relief to Newton to be able to reveal his secret to someone . He expresses the hope that the Antheans he will ferry to Earth will flourish and use their superior intelligence to help Earth achieve peace , prosperity , and safety . However , the CIA arrests Newton , having followed him since his appearance on Earth and having recorded this private conversation with Bryce . They submit him to rigorous tests and analysis , resulting in conclusive evidence of his alien identity , but decide not to release the results for fear they would simply not be believed , and possibly even embarrass the government , which at this point is controlled by the Democratic Party . Newton is released , but is immediately arrested by the FBI , which begins its own examinations . Their final examination is an X-ray of Newton s skull , through his eyes . Newton , whose eyes are sensitive to X-rays , is unable to stop them and is blinded . The story of Newton s blinding becomes a scandal which enables the Republicans to take power , eventually leading to a catastrophe . Newton , speaking to Bryce for the last time , explains bitterly that he is unable to continue his spaceship project because of his blindness and because of planetary alignments which have changed during his captivity . He records a message which he hopes to broadcast via radio to his home planet .


Thomas Jerome Newton is a humanoid alien who comes to Earth seeking to construct a spaceship to ferry others from his home planet , Anthea , to Earth . Anthea is experiencing a terrible drought after many nuclear wars , and the population has dwindled to less than 300 . Their own starships are unusable for lack of fuel and 500 years of neglect . The Antheans have no water , an abundance of food that is slowly dwindling , and feeble solar power . Like all Antheans , Newton is super-intelligent , but he has been selected for this mission because he has the physical strength necessary to function in Earth s hotter climate and higher gravity . Arriving at Earth in a lifeboat , Newton first lands in the state of Kentucky . He quickly becomes familiar with the environment and forms a plan . Using advanced technology from his home planet , Newton patents many inventions , and amasses incredible wealth as the head of a technology-based conglomerate . He plans to use this wealth to construct space vehicles for the rest of the Anthean population . Along the way he meets Betty Jo , who falls in love with him . He does not return these feelings , but takes her and his curious fuel-technician Nathan Bryce as his friends , while he runs his company in the shadows .

The story is narrated by Overton , godfather to the central character . The novel takes its beginnings in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to trace Ernest s emergence from previous generations of the Pontifex family . John Pontifex was a carpenter ; his son George rises in the world to become a publisher ; George s son Theobald , pressed by his father to become a minister , is manipulated into marrying Christina , the daughter of a clergyman ; the main character Ernest Pontifex is the eldest son of Theobald and Christina . The author depicts an antagonistic relationship between Ernest and his hypocritical and domineering parents . His aunt Alethea is aware of this relationship , but dies before she can fulfill her aim of counteracting the parents ' malign influence on the boy . However , shortly before her death she secretly passes a small fortune into Overton s keeping , with the agreement that once Ernest is twenty-eight , he can receive it . As Ernest develops into a young man , he travels a bumpy theological road , reflecting the divisions and controversies in the Church of England in the Victorian era . Easily influenced by others at university , he starts out as an Evangelical Christian , and soon becomes a clergyman . He then falls for the lures of the High Church ( and is duped out of much of his own money by a fellow clergyman ) . He decides that the way to regenerate the Church of England is to live among the poor , but the results are , first , that his faith in the integrity of the Bible is severely damaged by a conversation with one of the poor he was hoping to redeem , and , second , that under the pressures of poverty and theological doubt , he attempts a sexual assault on a woman he had incorrectly believed to be of loose morals . This assault leads to a prison term . His parents disown him . His health deteriorates . As he recovers he learns how to tailor and decides to make this his profession once out of prison . He loses his Christian faith . He marries Ellen , a former housemaid of his parents , and they have two children and set up shop together in the second-hand clothing industry . However , in due course he discovers that Ellen is both a bigamist and an alcoholic . Overton at this point intervenes and pays Ellen a stipend , and she happily leaves with another for America . He gives Ernest a job , and takes him on a trip to Continental Europe . In due course Ernest becomes 28 , and receives his aunt Alethea s gift . He returns to the family home until his parents die : his father s influence over him wanes as Theobald s own position as a clergyman is reduced in stature , though to the end Theobald finds small ways purposefully to annoy him . Ernest becomes an author of controversial literature .

However , shortly before her death she secretly passes a small fortune into Overton s keeping , with the agreement that once Ernest is twenty-eight , he can receive it . As Ernest develops into a young man , he travels a bumpy theological road , reflecting the divisions and controversies in the Church of England in the Victorian era . Easily influenced by others at university , he starts out as an Evangelical Christian , and soon becomes a clergyman . He then falls for the lures of the High Church ( and is duped out of much of his own money by a fellow clergyman ) . He decides that the way to regenerate the Church of England is to live among the poor , but the results are , first , that his faith in the integrity of the Bible is severely damaged by a conversation with one of the poor he was hoping to redeem , and , second , that under the pressures of poverty and theological doubt , he attempts a sexual assault on a woman he had incorrectly believed to be of loose morals . This assault leads to a prison term . His parents disown him . His health deteriorates . As he recovers he learns how to tailor and decides to make this his profession once out of prison . He loses his Christian faith . He marries Ellen , a former housemaid of his parents , and they have two children and set up shop together in the second-hand clothing industry . However , in due course he discovers that Ellen is both a bigamist and an alcoholic . Overton at this point intervenes and pays Ellen a stipend , and she happily leaves with another for America . He gives Ernest a job , and takes him on a trip to Continental Europe . In due course Ernest becomes 28 , and receives his aunt Alethea s gift . He returns to the family home until his parents die : his father s influence over him wanes as Theobald s own position as a clergyman is reduced in stature , though to the end Theobald finds small ways purposefully to annoy him . Ernest becomes an author of controversial literature .


During a train ride , Pozdnyshev overhears a conversation concerning marriage , divorce and love . When a woman argues that marriage should not be arranged but based on true love , he asks what is love ? and points out that , if understood as an exclusive preference for one person , it often passes quickly . Convention dictates that two married people stay together , and initial love can quickly turn into hatred . He then relates how he used to visit prostitutes when he was young , and complains that women s dresses are designed to arouse men s desires . He further states that women will never enjoy equal rights to men as long as men view them as objects of desire , yet describes their situation as a form of power over men , mentioning how much of society is geared towards their pleasure and well-being and how much sway they have over men s actions . After he meets and marries his wife , periods of passionate love and vicious fights alternate . She bears five children , and then receives contraceptives : The last excuse for our swinish life -- children -- was then taken away , and life became viler than ever . His wife takes a liking to a violinist , Troukhatchevsky , and the two perform Beethoven s Kreutzer Sonata ( Sonata No . 9 in A Major for piano and violin , Op . 47 ) together . Pozdnyshev complains that some music is powerful enough to change one s internal state to a foreign one . He hides his raging jealousy and goes on a trip , returns early , finds Troukhatchevsky and his wife together and kills his wife with a dagger . The violinist escapes : I wanted to run after him , but remembered that it is ridiculous to run after one s wife s lover in one s socks ; and I did not wish to be ridiculous but terrible . Later acquitted of murder in light of his wife s apparent adultery , Pozdnyshev rides the trains seeking forgiveness from fellow passengers .

A group of grifters rip off their latest mark and celebrate , while de facto leader of the group Jake Vig ( Edward Burns ) explains the art of the con . When one of the four ( Louis Lombardi ) is found shot to death , the other three learn that the latest money they stole actually belonged to a local L.A. crime lord called The King ( Dustin Hoffman ) . Jake proposes that the grifters work for the King and steal money from Morgan Price ( Robert Forster ) , a rival who owns a bank . Jake enlists the aid of his remaining partners , Gordo ( Paul Giamatti ) and Miles ( Brian Van Holt ) , and also convinces an independent con artist named Lily ( Rachel Weisz ) to round out their foursome . The King , a ruthless killer who suffers from ADHD , demands that one of his men , Lupus ( Franky G ) , also come along . The con involves bribing a bank vice president into wiring money offshore . The plan hits a snag when Special Agent Gunther Butan ( Andy Garca ) shows up in L.A. , looking to finally bust Jake , whom he has followed for years . Butan forces corrupt LAPD detectives Omar Manzano ( Luis Guzmn ) and Lloyd Whitworth ( Donal Logue ) to switch their allegiance from Jake to him . After hearing about Butan s arrival , a nervous Jake pulls the plug on the whole con . He screams at Lily , making her walk out . Lupus gets Jake to reconsider nixing the con , hinting that The King will torture and kill the grifters if the plan falls short . The con is back on , though now without Lily s help . The bribed bank VP wires the money to Gordo in Belize . Gordo brings it to Ontario Airport , where he is met by both Butan and The King s men , both sides after the $ 5 million in a duffle bag . Butan arrests The King and confiscates the money . Gordo disappears . Lupus , thinking the King has the money , reveals he was the one who killed Jake s grifter friend . Lupus holds Jake at gunpoint , but is shot by Travis ( Morris Chestnut ) , a henchman for Morgan Price . It turns out that when Lily walked out , she went straight to Price himself and revealed the entire con , which was taking place that minute . Price told Travis to locate Jake and find out exactly how the con was engineered , to stop such a thing from ever happening again . Travis takes Jake to an abandoned lot and forces him to explain the entire story . A furious Lily takes out a gun and kills Jake . Travis demands that he and Lily both disappear immediately . Minutes later , Butan arrives in a car and Jake sits up from a pool of blood , unharmed . The final parts of the con are revealed . Lily s quitting was fakeda set-up to confuse Lupus . Butan is actually an old confidant of Jake s . He managed to confiscate the money and arrest The King at the same time . Butan has the money and it s split five ways . Jake was wearing squibs to fake his own death in the lot . In the end , everyone was in on everything except for The King and Lupus ( the first marks ) , Price and Travis ( the second , bigger marks ) , and the two corrupt LAPD detectives , who have been arrested . The four grifters reunite and celebrate .
